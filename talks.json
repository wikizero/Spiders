part.\"Because spouses are bound togetherby their decisions,in marriage and in divorce.", "So, a mentor of mine once told me,\"You should always marryyour second husband first.\"", "(Laughter)", "What did that mean?It didn't mean that Mr. Rightis somehow waiting behind door number two.It meant that if you want to understandwhat makes a marriage work,you should thinkabout how a marriage ends.Divorce makes extremely explicitwhat the tacit rules of marriage are.And everyone shouldunderstand those rules,because doing so can help us buildbetter marriages from the beginning.I know, it doesn't sound very romantic,but sometimes the things we do out of lovecan be the very thingsthat make it hard for that love to last.", "I am a family-law professor.I have taught students,I've been an attorney,I'm a mediatorand I've also been divorced.And I'm now happily marriedto my actual second husband.", "(Laughter)", "The reason that I thinkthis is so importantis that I think everyone should be havingsome of these very painful conversationsthat divorced people experience.These are painful conversationsabout what we contributed,what we owe,what we are willing to giveand what we give up.And also, what's important to us.Those conversations should be happeningin a good marriage,not after it is broken.Because when you wait until it's broken,it's too late.But if you have them early on,they can actually help builda better marriage.", "Three ideas that I wantto put on the tablefor you to consider.One, sacrifice should be thought ofas a fair exchange.Two, there's no such thingas free childcare.And three, what's yoursprobably becomes ours.So let me talk about each of these ideas.", "The first one,sacrifice should be a fair exchange.Take the example of Lisa and Andy.Lisa decides to go to medical schoolearly in the marriage,and Andy works to support them.And Andy works night shiftsin order to do that,and he also gives up a great jobin another city.He does this out of love.But of course, he also understandsthat Lisa's degreewill benefit them both in the end.But after a few years,Andy becomes neglected and resentful.And he starts drinking heavily.And Lisa looks at her lifeand she looks at Andy and she thinks,\"This is not the bargainI wanted to make.\"A couple of years go by,she graduates from medical school,and she files for a divorce.", "So in my perfect world,some kind of marriage mediatorwould have been able to talk to thembefore Lisa went to medical school.And at that point,that mediator might have asked,\"How exactly does fair exchange work?What does it look like in your marriage?What are you willing to giveand what are you willing to owe?\"So in a divorce,Lisa now probably is going to owe Andyfinancial support for years.And Andy ...no amount of financial supportis going to make him feel compensatedfor what he gave up,and the lost traction in his career.", "If the two of them had thoughtabout their split early on,what might have gone differently?Well, it's possible that Lisawould have decidedthat she would take loansor work a part-time jobin order to support her own tuitionso that Andy wouldn't have had to bearthe entire burden for that.And Andy might have decidedto take that job in that other cityand maybe the two of themwould have commuted for a couple of yearswhile Lisa finished her degree.", "So let's take another couple,Emily and Deb.They live in a big city,they have two children, they both work.Emily gets a job in a small town,and they decide to move there together.And Deb quits her jobto look after the children full-time.Deb leaves behind an extended family,her friendsand a job that she really liked.And in that small town,Deb starts to feel isolated and lonely.And 10 years later, Deb has an affair,and things fall apart.", "Now, the marriage mediatorwho would have come inbefore they movedand before Deb quit her jobmight have asked them,\"What do your choices about childcaredo to the obligationsyou have to each other?How do they affect your relationship?Because you have to rememberthat there is no such thingas free childcare.\"", "If the two of them had thoughtabout their split beforehand,what would have gone differently?Well, maybe Deb would haverealized a little betterhow much her family and her friendswere important to herprecisely in what she was taking on,which is full-time parenthood.Perhaps Emily,in weighing the excitementof the new job offermight have also thought aboutwhat that would mean for the cost to Deband what would be owed to Debas a result of her taking onfull-time parenthood.", "So, let's go back to Lisa and Andy.Lisa had an inheritancefrom her grandmotherbefore the marriage.And when they got married,they bought a home,and Lisa put that inheritancetoward a down payment on that home.And then Andy of course workedto make the mortgage payments.And all of their premaritaland marital propertybecame joined.That inheritance is now marital property.So, in a split, what's going to happen?They're going to have to sell the houseand split the proceeds,or one of them can buy the other out.", "So this marriage mediator,if they had talked to thembefore all of this happened,that person would have asked,\"What do you want to keep separateand what do you want to keep together?And how does that choiceactually support the securityof the marriage?Because you have to rememberthat what's yours,probably, will become ours,unless you actually are mindfuland take steps to do otherwise.\"", "So if they had thought about their split,maybe they would have decided differently,maybe Lisa would have thought,\"Maybe the inheritance can stay separate,\"and saved for a daywhen they might actually need it.And maybe the mortgage that they took onwouldn't have been as onerous,and maybe Andy wouldn't have hadto work so hard to make those payments.And maybe he would havebecome less resentful.Maybe they would have livedin a smaller houseand been content to do that.", "The point is,if they had hada divorce-conscious discussionabout what to keep separate,their marriage might have beenmore connected and more together.Too often in marriage, we make sacrifices,and we demand them,without reckoning their cost.But there is wisdomin looking at the price tagsattached to our marital decisionsin just the way that divorce lawteaches us to do.", "What I wantis for people to thinkabout their marital bargainsthrough the lens of divorce.And to ask,\"How is marriage a sacrifice,but an exchange of sacrifice?How do we think about our exchange?\"Second:\"How do we think about childcareand deal with the factthat there is no such thingas free childcare?\"\"How do we deal with the factthat some things can be separateand some things can be together,and if we don't think about it,then it will all be partof the joint enterprise.\"", "So basically,what I want to leave you withis that in marriage or divorce,people should think about the waythat \"till death do us part\" marriageis forever.", "Thank you.", "(Applause)" ] } }

meaningfullyinto education,both on and off reserve.On reserve, education is fundedat significantly lower levelsthan it is off reserve.And off reserve,Indigenous language educationis often neglected,because people assumethat Indigenous peopleare not present in provincial schools,when actually, around 70 percentof Indigenous people in Canada todaylive off reserve.Those children have equal rightto access their language and culture.", "Beyond policy, we need support.And that doesn't just meanfinancial support.We need space where we cancarry out activities,classes and interactionwith nonindigenous populations as well.We need supportthat looks like peoplewanting to learn the language.We need support where people talkabout why these languages are important.And to achieve that, we need education.We need access to immersioneducation primarily,as that is most certainlythe most effective wayto ensure the transmissionof Indigenous languages.But we also need educationin provincial schools,we need educationfor the nonindigenous populationsso that we can come to a bettermutual understandingand move forward in a better way together.", "I have this quote hangingin a framed picture on my office wall.It was a gift from a settler ally studentthat I taught a few years ago,and it reminds me every daythat we can achieve great thingsif we work together.But if we're going to talkabout reconciliation,we need to acknowledgethat a reconciliation that does not resultin the survivance and continuationof Indigenous languages and culturesis no reconciliation at all.It is assimilation,and it shouldn't beacceptable to any of us.But what we can dois look to the calls to action,we can look to the UnitedNations Declarationon the Rights of Indigenous Peopleand we can come to a mutual understandingthat what we have,in terms of linguisticand cultural heritagefor Indigenous people in this country,is worth saving.Based on that, we can step forward,together,to

six-month-old son in one of thosefront-facing baby carriers,you know, so he could see everything.And when I turned right on Sixth Avenue,what he sawwas the World Trade Center on fire.", "As soon as I realizedthat this was an attack,the first thing I did, without evenreally thinking about it,was to take my babyand turn him around in that carrier.I didn't want him to seewhat was going on.And I just remember feeling so gratefulthat he was still young enoughthat I didn't have to tell himthat someone had done this on purpose.", "9/11 was like crossing a border,a hostile border into dangerous,uncharted territory.The world was suddenlyin this terrifying new place,and I was in this place as a new mother.I remember my thoughtskind of ping-ponging aroundfrom, \"How am I evergoing to protect this baby?\"to, \"How am I evergoing to get some sleep?\"", "Well, my son turned 18 this year,along with millions of other peoplewho were babies on 9/11.And in that time,we have all crossed into this hostile,uncharted territoryof climate breakdown,of endless wars,of economic meltdowns,of deep political divisions,of the many crises around the worldthat I don't need to list off,because they are blaring at youevery single day from your news feed.", "But there is something I've learnedin these 18 years of parentingand in my years leadinga global women's rights organization.There is a way to facethese big crises in the worldwithout feeling overwhelmedand despairing.It's simple, and it's powerful.It's to think like a mother.", "Now, to be clear, you don'thave to be a womanor a parent to do this.Thinking like a mother is a lensthat's available to everybody.The poet Alexis De Veaux writes,\"Motherhood is not simplythe organic process of giving birth.It's an understandingof the needs of the world.\"", "Now, it's easy to focus onall of the obstaclesto making this the world we want:greed, inequality, violence.Yes, there is all of that.But there's also the optionto plant a seed, a different seed,and cultivate what you want to see grow,even in the midst of crisis.", "Majid from Iraq understands this.He is a housepainter by tradeand someone who believes deeplyin equal rights for women.When ISIS invadednorthern Iraq where he lives,he worked with a localwomen's organizationto help build an underground railroad,an escape networkfor women's rights activistsand LGBTIQ folks who were targetedwith assassination.And when I asked Majidwhy he risked his own lifeto bring people to safety,he said to me,\"If we want a brighter future,we have to build it now in the dark timesso that one day we can live in the light.\"That's what social justice work is,and that's what mothers do.We act in the presentwith an idea of the futurethat we want to bring about.", "All of the best ideasseem impossible at first.But just in my lifetime,we've seen the end of apartheid,the affirmation thatwomen's rights are human rights,marriage equality,the fall of dictatorswho ruled for decadesand so much more.All of these things seemed impossibleuntil people took actionto make them happen,and then, like, almost right away,they seemed inevitable.", "When I was growing up,whether we were stuck in trafficor dealing with a family tragedy,my mother would say,\"Something good is going to happen,we just don't know what it is yet.\"Now, I will admit that my brothers and Imake fun of her for this,but people ask me all the timehow I deal with the sufferingthat I see in my workin refugee camps and disaster zones,and I think of my momand that seed of possibilitythat she planted in me.Because, when you believethat something good is comingand you're part of making it happen,you start to be able to seebeyond the sufferingto how things could be.", "Today, there is a new setof necessary ideasthat seem impossiblebut one day will feel inevitable:that we could end violence against women,make war a thing of the past,learn to live in balance with naturebefore it's too lateand make sure that everybodyhas what they need to thrive.", "Of course, being able to picturea future like this is not the same thingas knowing what to doto make it come about,but thinking like a mothercan help with that, too.A few years ago,East Africa was gripped by a famine,and women I know from Somaliawalked for days carryingtheir hungry childrenin search of food and water.A quarter of a million people died,and half of them were babies and toddlers.And while this catastrophe unfolded,too much of the world looked away.But a group of women farmers in Sudan,including Fatima Ahmed --that's her holding the corn --heard about what was happening.And they pooled together the extra moneythat they had from their harvestand asked me to send itto those Somali mothers.Now, these farmers could have decidedthat they didn't have the power to act.They were barely getting by themselves,some of them.They lived without electricity,without furniture.But they overrode that.They did what mothers do:they saw themselves as the solutionand they took action.", "You do it all the time if you have kids.You make major decisionsabout their health care,their education,their emotional well-being,even if you're not a doctoror a teacher or a therapist.You recognize what your child needsand you step up to provide itthe best you can.Thinking like a mother meansseeing the whole worldthrough the eyes of thosewho are responsiblefor its most vulnerable people.And we're not used to thinkingof subsistence farmers as philanthropists,but those women were practicingthe root meaning of philanthropy:love for humanity.", "What's at the core of thinkinglike a mother shouldn't be a surprise:it's love.Because, love is morethan just an emotion.It's a capacity, a verb,an endlessly renewable resource --and not just in our private lives.We recognize hate in the public sphere.Right? Hate speech, hate crimes.But not love.What is love in the public sphere?Well, Cornel West, who is nota mother but thinks like one,says it best:\"Justice is what lovelooks like in public.\"And when we remember that every policyis an expression of social values,love stands out as that superstar value,the one best able to accountfor the most vulnerable among us.And when we position loveas a kind of leading edgein policy making,we get new answersto fundamental social questions,like, \"What's the economy for?\"\"What is our commitmentto those in the path of the hurricane?\"\"How do we greet thosearriving to our borders?\"", "When you think like a mother,you prioritize the needs of the many,not the whims of the few.When you think like a mother,you don't build a seawallaround beachfront property,because that would divert floodwatersto communities that are still exposed.When you think like a mother,you don't try to prosecute someonefor leaving water for peoplecrossing the desert.Because, you know --", "(Applause)", "Because you know that migration,just like mothering,is an act of hope.", "Now, not every motherthinks like a mother.When presented with a choice,some of us have made the wrong one,hiding behind weaponsor barbed wire or privilegeto deny the rest of the world,thinking they can see their way to safetyin some kind of armed lifeboatfueled by racism and xenophobia.Not every mother is a role model,but all of us have a choice.Are we going to jumpon that armed lifeboator work together to build a mother shipthat can carry everyone?", "You know how to build that mother ship,how to repair the worldand ease the suffering.Think like a mother.Thinking like a motheris a tool we can all useto build the world we want.", "Thank you.", "(Applause)" ] } }

up in Germany,the fall of the Berlin Wallalways felt to melike the introduction of a new world,a world without barriers.But since the attacks of 9/11,the construction has experiencedan extreme rise.Since then, the amount has doubled,with about 30 new structuresthat were planned or built.Walls and fences are often builtwith the intention of security,security from another group of people,from crime, from illegal trades.But walls and fences only provide uswith a feeling of security,which is different from real security.Even though they might make us feel safe,the structures themselvescan't protect us.", "Instead, they do something else:they separate.They create an us and a them.They establish an enemy.Walls make us build a second wallin our head, a mental wall.And those mental wallsslowly make us lose sightof all the things we have in commonwith the people on the other side.The other way around,mental walls can grow so strongthat they encourage us to build,keep or strengthen physical walls.", "Physical and mental wallsare closely interlinked,and one almost alwayscomes with the other.It's a constant cycle:physical walls empower mental walls,and mental walls empower physical wallsuntil at one point one part falls away,and the cycle is disrupted.", "When the Berlin Wall was being built,it was hard to tellwho the wall was facing,because the people living around itidentified as one.There was no us and them.There was no others.During the time of separation,both sides developed differentlyand formed individual identities.All of a sudden, there wasan us and a them.A mental wall was built,and when the Berlin Wallfell again in 1989,this mental wall in the headof the people stayed.Eastern Germans had to be reintegratedinto their own country,and even though they didn'thave to move places,many still today feel likethey have never fully arrived.Those remaining effectsof the mental wall are also measurable.", "A study from the Freie Universityof Berlin in 2005shows that even 15 yearsafter the reunification,Germans still believed that citieson the other side of the former wallare further away than they really are.The interesting thing is that they founda link between political attitudeand estimation of the distance.The more a participant was againstthe German reunification,the further awaythey estimated cities to be.It's the mental wall which keepscities on the other side far away,and the higher and strongerthis mental wall,the more difficultthey seem to be reached.", "I tried to repeat this studywith a group of young Germanswho grew up without the wallto see if these effectsare still measurable nowadays.And the results show that this generation,my generation,is just kind of badat geography in general --", "(Laughter)", "East and West.But in our defense, this could be seenas an improvement, right?We never experienced the actual wall.This physical barrier was never ableto make us build a mental wallin the first place.", "I would love to take thisas a serious indicationthat there could be a futurewithout a mental wall dividing Germany,but I think we have to face reality:this one wall could be disappearing,but in the meanwhile,a billion others are constructed.One global trendwe are currently experiencingis the rise of gated communities.And in a way, gated communities can beseen the same exact way as countries,just on the small scale --neighborhoods surroundedby walls and fencesto protect citizens from other citizens --and the only difference is,it's by choice.But the physical and mental effectson the people living insideand the people kept outsideare the same,separating cities, neighborhoodsand even playgrounds.", "In the spring of last year,I worked on a design project in Brusselsat two elementary schoolswhere this was the case.Both the schools share an entranceand the schoolyard.Both schools teach in Dutch.But one school is mainly visitedby Belgian children,and the other school,by immigrant children.The schools are separatedby walls and fences,leaving the childrenno point of interactionother than this fence on the schoolyardthat separates them.When I started to work there,it made me sad to see childrenhaving to stand at a fenceto talk to their friend on the other side.But what's even worse is thatmost of the childrenwill never get the opportunityto even make a friend on the other side.", "School should be the placewhere children, all children,come together and learn --learn from the teacher,but more importantly,learn from each other.And the more diversity,the more there is to learn.In fact, school might bethe only time in our liveswhere establishing a contact despitesocial differences is even possible.Separating children duringthis time of their developmentwill make integration extremely difficult,if not impossible.", "And yet, somehow,I seem to be the only one havinga problem with this fence in Brussels.Most of the parents, teachers and childrenstopped seeing or at leastquestioning the structure.It's just how it is.Nobody has ever seen it differently.And people are in favor of it.I once asked a boy if he would liketo play with the other side,and he said, \"No.\"Then I asked if he would play with themif the fence wasn't there,and he said, \"Probably.\"But then he quickly addedthat the fence should stay,because the other side is meanand they never give back his ball.It's funny, because I talkedto children from both sides,and everyone told methat the other side is meanbecause they never give back the ball.The children on both sidesdislike each other,and there are regularly argumentsbreaking out at this fence,which is also the main reasonwhy people feel the needfor it to be there:it protects the children from each other,or at least their toys,and it prevents chaos.At some point, the children startedto crawl beneath the fenceto get their ball back,and the reaction of the schoolswas to put these metal plates there.Now they climb over.", "I don't know what came first in Brussels:a mental wall that grew too strongthat it made them build a physical fence,or this fence that now emphasizesthe social differences,even on the schoolyard.But what I did knowwhen I started to work therewas that I wanted to change somethingabout the situation.I wanted to show both sides againhow much they have in common.For children, this isn't very hard,because even thoughone schoolyard speaks Dutchand the other schoolyard, a mixof French, Turkish and Arabic,they all speak the universallanguage of play.And it turned out the desire to playis a lot stronger than allthe supposed differences between them.I installed different games at the fence,which turned it into an interface,a common ground,instead of a barrier.And all of a sudden,children were drawing together,exchanging pencilsand talking on the phone.Especially the phoneswere a great success,because they were so amazedby the fact that they can hearthe other side through this devicethat they couldn't stop speaking.", "In the case of an elementary school,parents play a very big rolein shaping the everyday lifeand the environment of their children.So I knew that if I wantedto make a difference,I had to somehow show them, too,how much they have in commonwith the other side.But for parents, this wasa lot more difficult,because most of themspeak different languages,work different jobswith different incomes,live in different social circles,believe in different religions,experience different culturesand share different values.And then there was me,a student,different in all of these aspects again.So how could I show themhow much they have in common?", "I chose not to convince them myselfbut by letting their ownchildren do the talking.I designed a picture exhibitionon the schoolyardshowing them their childrenplaying together through the fence.At the end of this exhibition,I asked people to write downtheir thoughts, ideas and wisheson these big wooden boxes,and I labeled the boxeswith, \"What do you think?\"A lot of people wrote \"Yes\" on it.Yes, what?I never mentioned my opinionor an action that should follow,so which questionwere they answering with yes?When I asked, they said yes,the fence should go.Yes, we want to play with the other side.The pictures implied enoughto answer a questionthat was never proposed.People were seeing the absurdityof the situation againand felt how unnecessary this fence iswithout me forcing an opinion on them.The exhibition showed the two sidestheir similarities for once.That day, there was no us and them,there was no others.The mental wall started to crumble.", "I chose the word \"crumbling,\"because breaking a mental wallis a long journey,and breaking a mental wallcan be a lot more difficultthan simply tearing down the physical one.We have to challengeour opinion and beliefsand maybe even admit our own wrongs.So what happened in Brusselswas a big step,a step that has been takinggenerations in Germany.", "There are many examplesfrom all over the worldtelling the same story I experiencedin Brussels and Germany,enough examples from whichwe could have learned.But still, we seek walls as solutionsfor problems that they cannot solve,because walls don't fightthe root of our problem.If anything, they reduce the symptoms.", "So the next time youare planning to build a wallor you are planning to support someonewho wants to build a wall,I want you to rememberthe impact you are really having.Because, this simple structurewill hardly create more security.Instead, it will affect the peopleliving with it every day,people who, despite the geographic border,often share a lot of culture and values.For them, you are not buildingone wall but two,two walls which will take decadesand generations to overcome again.", "Thank you.", "(Applause)" ] } }

imagine if butterflieswere yakking out there all over the place?", "But I would like to ask butterfliesone question, which is,what is the meaning of some of the storiesthat we humans tell about them?Because remarkably, all over the world,cultures have really similar stories,similar mythologies about butterflieshaving to do with the human soul.Some cultures tell us butterfliesare carrying the souls of childrenwho have died wrongly or too soon,and other culturestell us that butterfliesare carrying the soulsof our ancestors among us.This butterfly is calleda Kallima inachus.On one side, it lookslike a beautiful butterfly,and on the other side,it looks like a leaf,and it folds up like a leafto elude predators.So now you see it, now you don't,something hidden, something revealed.Maybe we got our ideas aboutthe human soul from this butterfly.", "So it's possible that butterflieshave some sort of outsized rolein our afterlife.But in this life, in this world,butterflies are in really serious trouble.", "This is a moth.Moths and butterflies are related.Moths generally fly at night.This is called \"praedicta,\" becauseDarwin predicted that it must exist.", "So today, more than 60 speciesof butterflies are endangeredaround the world,but even more than that,insects are declining,declining, declining.In the last 50 years,we've lost nearly 50 percentof the total number of bodies of insects.Now this is a disaster.It could impact us in a more serious waymore quickly than climate change,because butterflies don't do that muchin the ecosystem that we depend on,but they do things for other creaturesthat we do depend on,and that's the same storywith all insect life.Insect life is at the very foundationof our life-support systems.We can't lose these insects.Biodiversity all over the globeis in a vast decline.Habitat loss, pesticides, herbicidesand impacts of climate change.Habitat loss is very serious,and that's where we reallyhave to get developing better,more mindfully.", "It's the worst of times,we are kind of overloadedwith our problems.It's also the best of times --there's incredibly good news.We have exactly what we need.We have exactly the platformto save nature.It's called citizen science.", "So citizen science is generally a termused to mean people without a PhDcontributing to scientific research.Sometimes, it's called community science,which gets at the communal purposeof citizen science,which is to do somethingfor our commons together.It's amateur science.It's being turbocharged todayby vast computing power,statistical analysis and the smartphone,but it's an ancient practicethat people have always practiced.It's amateur science.Professional sciencehas its roots in amateur science.", "Charles Darwin was a citizen scientist.He had no advanced degree,and he worked only for himself.So someone showed Darwinthis Madagascar star orchid,which as a spur that's 12 inches long,and the spur is the part of a flowerthat the nectar is in.So this person showed thisto Darwin and said,\"This proves that evolutiondoes not come about in a natural way.This flower proves that only Godcan make these incredibly bizarreand tricky-looking creatures on the earth,because no insectcould possibly pollinate this.God must reproduce it.\"And Darwin said, \"No, I'm surethat there is an insect somewherewith a proboscis long enoughto pollinate that star orchid.\"And he was right.", "This is a map of the monarch butterfly.So, the monarch butterflyhas a different storythan that particular moth,but reflects the same kindof fundamental idea that Darwin hadcalled coevolution,and coevolution is at the heartof how nature works,and it's also at the heartof what's going wrong with nature today.So over time, as the mothdeveloped a longer proboscis,so the plant developed a longer spur.Over millions of years,the plant and the mothdeveloped a relationshipwhereby they both make each other'schances of existence better.The monarch butterfly has a different kindof coevolutionary relationship,and today, it is at the heartof what's going wrongfor the monarch butterfly.", "So this is a map ofthe monarch butterfly migration.The monarch does this amazing thing,and over the course of a year,it goes over the entiretyof North America.It does this in four or five generations.The first generationsonly live a couple of weeks.They mate, they lay eggs and they die.The next generation emerges as butterfliesand takes the next leg of the journey.Nobody knows how they do it.By the time the fifth generation comesback around -- and that one lives longer,they overwinterin Mexico and California --by the time it gets there,those butterflies are going backto where their ancestors came from,but they've never been there before,and nobody that they're immediatelyrelated to has been there before either.We don't know how they do it.", "The reason we knowthey do this kind of migration --and we still have a lotof unanswered questionsabout the monarch migration --is because of citizen science.So for decades,people have made observationsabout monarch butterflies,where and when they see them,and they've contributed these observationsto platforms like Journey North.This is a map of some observationsof butterflies given to Journey North.And if you can see the dots are codedby what time of yearthose observations were made.So these massive amounts of datacome into a place like Journey North,and they can create a mapof this time of over a course of a yearof where monarchs go.Also because of citizen science,we understand that monarch butterflynumbers are going down, down, down.So in the 1980s, the overwinteringbutterflies here in California,there were four million counted.Last year, 30,000.", "(Audience gasps)", "Four million to 30,000 since the 1980s.The monarchs on the east coastare doing a little better,but they're also going down.", "OK, so what are we going to do about it?Well, very organically,nobody really asking anybody to do it,people all over the continentare supporting monarch butterflies.", "The heart of the problemfor monarchs is milkweed.It's another coevolutionary relationship,and here's the story.Milkweed is toxic.It has a poison in it that it evolvedto deter other insects from eating it,but the monarch developeda different kind of relationship,a different strategy with the milkweed.Not only does it tolerate the toxin,the monarch actually sequestersthe toxin in its body,thus becoming poisonous to its predators.Monarch butterflies will onlylay their eggs on milkweed,and monarch caterpillarswill only eat milkweed,because they need that toxin to actuallycreate what they are as a species.", "So people are planting milkweedall over the countrywhere we have lost milkweeddue to habitat destruction,pesticide use, herbicide useand climate change impacts.You can create a lot of butterfly habitatand pollinator habitat on a windowsill.You go to a native nursery in your areaand find out what's nativeto where you live,and you will bringbeautiful things to yourself.", "Now, citizen science can do even morethan rescue monarch butterflies.It has the capacity to scaleto the level necessarythat we need to mobilize to save nature.And this is an example.It's called City Nature Challenge,and City Nature Challenge is a projectof the California Academy of Sciencesand the Los AngelesMuseum of Natural History.So for four years, City Nature Challengehas enjoined cities all over the globeto participate in counting upbiodiversity in their cities.We're up to, like,a million observations of biodiversitycollected by peoplearound the globe this past April.The winner this year was South Africa,much to the chagrin of San Francisco.", "(Laughter)", "Look at them, they havemore biodiversity than we do.It's kind of an interesting thing,what is revealed when you start seeingwhat are the natural resourceswhere you live,because as we go forward, you want to livewhere there's more biodiversity.And by the way, citizen scienceis a very good tool for social justiceand environmental justice goals,for helping reach them.You need to have dataand you need to show a picture,you need to point to a causeand then you need to havethe surgical striketo help support whatever that problem is.", "So City Nature Challenge, I think,should get a commendation from the UN.Has there ever been a global efforton behalf of natureundertaken in this coordinated manner?It's amazing, it's fantasticand it's really a pretty grassroots thing,and we get very interesting informationabout butterflies and other creatureswhen we do these bioblitzes.", "City Nature Challenge basically workswith a tool called iNaturalist,and iNaturalist is your entry drugto citizen science. (Laughs)I suggest signing up for iton a laptop or on a desktop,and then you put the app on your phone.With iNaturalist, you take a pictureof a bird, a bug, a snake, anything,and an artificial intelligence functionand an expert vetting systemworks to verify that observation.The app gives the observation the date,the time, the latitude and the longitude,geolocates that observation.That's the data, that's the scienceof citizen science.And then that data is shared,and that sharing,that is the soul of citizen science.When we share data,we can see much bigger picturesof what's going on.There's no way to seethat whole monarch migrationwithout sharing datathat's been collected over decades,seeing the heart and soulof how nature worksthrough citizen science.", "This is a Xerces blue butterfly,which went extinct when it lostits habitat in Golden Gate Park.It had a coevolutionary relationshipwith an ant, and that's another story.", "(Laughter)", "I'll end by asking you,please participate in citizen sciencein some way, shape or form.It is an amazingly positive thing.It takes an army of peopleto make it really work.", "And I'll just add that I think butterfliesprobably really do haveenough on their platewithout carrying around human souls.", "(Laughter)", "But there's a lot we don't know, right?And what about all those stories?What are those stories telling us?Maybe we coevolved our soulswith butterflies?Certainly, we are connected to butterfliesin deeper ways than we currently know,and the mystery of the butterflywill never be revealedif we don't save them.So, please join mein helping to save nature now.", "Thank you.", "(Applause)" ] } }

That's great.We have sunshine here in the Northeast,which is nice.", "CA: So look, I am excitedto introduce this guest,because I've known Seth Berkleyfor a long time.I count him as a friend.He's a man who has really devoted his lifeto the most profound questionsabout public health.Vaccines are extraordinary.They save millions of lives.The quest for a coronavirus vaccineis, I think, the biggest single questionthat the world faces nowif we're going to get out of this.So it's just a delightto welcome Dr. Seth Berkleyto TED Connects.Come on in, Seth.", "Seth Berkley: Goodto see you there, Chris,and delighted to be with youand all of the TED community.", "CA: Well, so look, on Tuesday,Bill Gates was here,and he mentioned thatyour organization, Gavi,is really at the heartof the quest for a vaccine.So tell us a bit -- what is Gavi?", "SB: So Chris, thank you for that.What's interesting is that20 years ago --we just celebrated our 20th anniversary --there were all these powerful new vaccinesthat were being used in wealthy countries,and the challenge is,they weren't getting to the placesthat they could make the most difference:the developing world.So Gavi was formed as an alliance --WHO, the World Bank, the Gates Foundation,UNICEF -- all working togetherto try to bring these vaccinesto the developing world.And it's been very successful.We've launched 433 new vaccinesin the most difficultcountries in the world,in the Somalias and Yemensand DRCs and Nigerias.But we've also set up emergency stockpilesfor outbreak-based vaccines,so if there's an outbreakanywhere in the worldof yellow fever or of thingslike cholera or meningitis and now Ebola,we have vaccinesthat are available to do that.And the last thing we are trying to dois build the health systems outto deliver these vaccines,but also to make sure that we canpay attention to new diseases that pop upin different parts of the world.", "CA: And just give us a senseof the scale of this.How many vaccinesdo you distribute in a given year?And how many lives do you believethat that may be saving?", "SB: So, let me give you a macro number.We've immunized more than760 million additional children --760 million additional children --and prevented more than 13 million deaths.In an average year, we giveabout a half a billion dosesbecause we started out with six diseases,but now we vaccinate against18 different diseases.", "CA: Yeah, the scale of that is incredible,and amidst all the bad newsthat's happening,it's kind of amazing that thisintervention can save so many lives.I mean, help us understandwhat a vaccine is.", "SB: So, the original idea,the word \"vaccine,\"comes from \"vaca,\" or cow.And the observation made in the 1700swas that milkmaids had beautiful skin,whereas everybody else had pockmarksfrom having gotten over smallpox.And the concept was that shewas getting infected with a zoonosis,that is, with naturally occurring cowpox,not smallpox.That then protected against smallpox.And it was tested in those days:Could you artificially do that?They of course didn't understand virology,they didn't understandany of those issues.But what a vaccineis is something that you giveto artificially stimulatethe immune system,hopefully to not make you sick.But then later on, when the body comesin contact with the real disease,it thinks it's already seen itand it is able to fight it offwithout making the person sick.", "CA: I mean, it's kind ofa miraculous thing to methat they work that way,that your body is always therelooking for these threats.And a vaccine, I guess, the bodyperceives it as a threat,and therefore arms itselfagainst that threat, right?And that's what gives the protection.So, is that why some people are sort of --irrationally, I will say --irrationally scared of vaccinesand feel that they may be dangerous,because they are a kind of threatthat you're putting into your bodyin a very subtle way?", "SB: Well, of course,when this first started,there were two ways to make vaccines.You could grind them up and inject them,so-called \"whole killed vaccines.\"So you took organismsand you got an immune response,and sometimes those organisms,even though they were dead,gave you a pretty whoppingimmune response:your arms were sore, you got fevers.Then we moved to theseweakened live viruses,and frankly, those are the best vaccines.That's what measles is.That's what yellow fever is.These are weakened viruses.They don't give you disease,but because they looklike the natural viruses,your body gets protection and, frankly,you get protection for your whole life.Today, because peopleare worried about side effects,we've begun to use molecular biologyand use little bits of it,and therefore, it's moved forward.But the reason people are mostly scaredis because, frankly, vaccineshave been so successful.You don't expect, if you havea child or two children,that those children are goingto die of these diseases,unlike in the past, when three or fourout of your five or six or seven kidswould die.So today, people think, well, gee,these diseases aren't around,they're not that bad and, by the way,if I'm injecting these things,maybe they're not organic,maybe it'll make my child cry,maybe it'll make them sick,and I don't need to do it.And that's the challenge.You don't want to scare people to deathon how bad these diseases can be,but at the same time,you want them to understandthat these diseases are seriousand can cause really baddisease and sequela.", "CA: So yesterday, you issueda really powerful callfor this massive, coordinatedglobal responseto tackle the searchfor a coronavirus vaccine.We're going to come that in a bit,because I thinkthat's a very exciting topic.But I think we needsome more background first.I want to go back five yearsto when you stood on the TED stageand you held uptwo candidate Ebola vaccines.This was just a few months after Ebolahad been terrifying the world.It was basically amazing how quicklythose vaccines had been developed.What happened to them?", "SB: It's a great question,and let me tell a little bit of the story,but at the end, there were two vaccines.One, it turned out,couldn't finish its testing,because the epidemic died down.The other one was fully tested.It had a hundred percent efficacy.We then went on to work with manufacturersto produce that vaccine,at least temporarily,in an investigational form,just in case there were more outbreaks.There were, and thoseare the vaccine dosesthat we've used in the DRC.In the last two outbreaks,280,000 people have been vaccinatedwith this experimental vaccine,and today, there is a licensed vaccine,and we are now procuring a globalstockpile of a half a million doses.But let me just say, Chris,the reason they came so quicklyat that moment is, after September 11th,there was concern in the USabout bioterrorism.Remember, there were anthrax attacks.And so what happened wasthere was a list of agents,and Ebola, for a short time,was on that list of agents,so people started making vaccines,and later on, they decided that wasnot necessarily a good bioterrorism agent,so they dropped that off the list.But in the freezers were vaccinesthat had been started,and they were dusted off,and that's why we could moveso quickly in that moment.", "CA: And yet, how long was itfrom that moment on the TED stagewith the candidate vaccineto actual deployment?", "SB: So, what happened was,the epidemic began to go down.The clinical trialI told you about was done.It was a heroicclinical trial done by WHO,and it showed that it had these results.That epidemic then stopped.We didn't know if there were goingto be more epidemics.It took another number of yearsto finish the work on the vaccineto make sure it was pure,to figure out howto manufacture it at scale.It's during that periodthat we put vaccine awayand had it available in casethere were other outbreaks.And it turned out,there were three outbreaks.One went away quickly, but there were two.I was there on day 13of the second outbreak.We injected the vaccine, cases went up,then they went down, and controlled it.And then this DRC in North Kivu outbreak,which really was terriblebecause it was in a war zone.And that's the one where we've beennot only vaccinating in DRCbut in surrounding countries.By the way, that is now, I believe,day 38 or 39 out of the 42 necessaryto say it's over.We hope it is.And that would be, again,an enormous exampleof what vaccines can do,even in a very difficult setting.", "CA: And yet, in one way, Seth,it's kind of shockingthat the outbreak that happenedat the start of 2015, end of 2014,that it happened at all,because the world has knownabout Ebola for a long time.It's been sequenced and so forth.A vaccine could have been developedand got ready for a possible outbreak.Why didn't that happen?", "SB: Well, there had been26 outbreaks before,but each one of them was small --couple of hundred peopleor a couple of dozen people --in the poorest Africancountries in the world.There was no market for it.People didn't know how to test itbecause they would just pop upand then go away.And so even though it was obviouslya disease that potentially could spread,it had never really spread before.Of course, in West Africa,they didn't havea good surveillance system;it spread for three months beforepeople identified that it was Ebola,and by that time, it was too late.It had spread.What's important about that lessonis that then caused huge disruptionacross Africa, across the world,because cases went to other places.And the challenge then was,and the reason we had to step in,was because there still was no market.So the Gavi board said,\"We will put out 390 million dollars.We'll put it out there and tell companies,we're open for business,we'll create a market,we'll buy the vaccine.\"And that led to companiesbeing willing to finish the investmentto get us to where we are today.", "CA: Right, right.So it's a real paradox, right?In a way, the very thingthat makes vaccines so extraordinary,that once they're developed,they are so cheap to administer,for a few dollars, I guess,you can administer this dosethat will save someonemaybe a lifetime of illnessor save their lives,and yet so much of medical researchand invention and developmentis done by companieswho need to see a revenue stream,and so they don't see itfrom those tiny little cheap thingsthat might save a lot of lives.So it's a real market failurethat in this circumstance now --That's one of the thingsI guess you're thinking hard about,how on earth do we get roundand avoid that market failurecrippling the response this time?", "SB: Well, first of all, one of the reasonsBill Gates likes vaccines is,in a sense, it's a little bitlike software creation.You put a lot of money and effortinto creating it,but once you've got it,you can produce it pretty cheaplyand use it in different placesaround the world.I don't want to beat upthe pharmaceutical industry herebecause they were heroic in Ebola,but I think realistically,they are for-profit entities,and they have to sayto their shareholders,\"Somebody's going to pay for this,or we're going to do itas a charitable thing.\"And if we do it as a charitable thing,they can't keep doing it.Since then, there is a new initiativecalled CEPI, the Coalitionfor Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.It was set up at Davos a few years ago,and its purpose is to try to make vaccinesfor the list of diseasesthat aren't yet known epidemicsbut that can potentially be there.And the idea would beusing public sector moneyto get us prepared.Of course, they jumped inon this coronavirus as well.Last thing is, of course,I'm not worried on a coronavirus stagethat this is a problem,with not having a market.One of the challenges here is thatthere may be too big a market for this,and therefore, how do we make surethere's access for developing countries.", "CA: All right, so talk aboutthis virus, Seth.How is it different from Ebola?How challenging is itto create a vaccine for it?", "SB: So what's interestingabout coronavirusesis that they are animal viruses,probably primarily in bats.They jump into other animals sometimes,and then they jump into humans.So this shouldn't have been a surprise.This is the third coronavirusthat has jumped into humans.We had SARS in early 2002,we had MERS a number of years later,and now we have this virus.What's interesting is there is a databasethat shows there are 30,000-some-oddisolated coronaviruses in animals,and one of the thingsthat people tried to dowas say the way these coronaviruses workis they have a spike on them.They're called \"corona\"because they look like the sun.That spike is where it attachesto a certain receptor in people's lungs.And so somebody said, well, maybewe can begin to look at those spikesand see if they're similarto the human receptorsand they can be predicted.But the problem is people don't investin those types of research.And, of course, I think that,given it's an evolutionary certainty,we're going to see this,that we should be.But one other point about this iscoronavirus jumped into humansin ancient history as well,and so we have now about a thirdto a quarter of the common cold virusesare actually coronaviruses.And what's interesting about thoseis they don't make you deathly illlike these,but you also don't havelong-term immunity to them,so you can get reinfectedwith these virusesafter 10 months, a year.And so that does raisean issue on vaccinology,because you want to ideallyhave lifetime immunity.", "CA: The reason why we get reinfectedis because the virus mutates slightly,and so it escapes the antibodies?", "SB: No, no, not in this case.Not in this case.So in flu, that's what happens.The viruses are always mutating.In HIV, the reason we don't have a vaccineis because they're all mutating.In this case, the immune responseseems to get weaker and go away,and people get reinfectedwith the same viruses.Now, that is potentiallya solvable problem using vaccinologyand many different techniques,but the point is, we just can't assume.Some people noware talking about herd immunityas a way to deal with this virus,and the idea there is if you could getenough people infected --you know, forget for a momentthat a lot of people are going to dieand be miserable while that happens --but the idea is that you geta certain level immunity in the community,and then the disease will go away.Well, that is only trueif you get long-term immunity.If you don't, then you could gothrough all of that horrible experience,have all those deaths,and then not have the protection you needto protect against this disease.", "CA: OK, so in a way,the quest we're looking foris a vaccine that will workfor the long term.I mean, I guess any vaccinethat works at all will be a huge gift,but it could well be onethat we have to retake every year,or something like that.", "SB: Right. That is certainly possible.Of course, we have to remember, though,that SARS and MERS both had even highermortality than this virus does,and they give a muchmore profound immune response.So it may be that they react differentlythan the common cold viruses.The challenge, of course, is thatwe haven't had the opportunityto study these over a long time,and this new disease --three and a half months, we've had it.More science has been donefor this diseasein this short period of time,but we don't understand fullythe epidemiology of the virus,the immune response, what's protective,which is the best animal model.All of that is being worked on by scienceand at breakneck pace,but a lot to learn.", "CA: So talk about how the medicaland the research community responded.Because, the Chinese authorities --I guess we heard it yesterday --only found out about thissometime in December.Already, early in January --I think the virus started in November,they found out about it in December --by early January, they had alreadyreleased a sequence of the virusto the world,and now here we are.And I think I saw thatmore than 40 companiesare already claiming candidate vaccines.What does it mean to havea candidate vaccine?Like, have companies tested thisalready against animals or something?Or are they just lookingat a computer model where they go,\"That should work\"?", "SB: Well, it's an interestingquestion you ask there.So first of all, China was heroic on this.They did post the genetic sequence of it.Today, we have companiesthat can sit down with a computerand from that genetic sequence,make what is a candidate vaccine.Now, a candidate vaccine obviously meansit's not a licensed product.It's something that somebodywants to work on.But you're right, you have to havethe right nomenclature,because \"candidate\" can meanI'm working on something, it's in my head,I'm just doing a little work on it,I've got something in a vial,I'm beginning to do testing on it.And so what we saw in that casewas a company called Moderna.That was the first vaccinethat went into humans.It's a messenger RNA-based system.I actually visited the company,not in this outbreak but before,because the technology is interesting.And what they were ableto do was, in 42 days,make a candidate vaccinefrom the genetic sequence.They didn't need the organism.That now is in clinical testing.Now, there is no licensed mRNA vaccine,so we're going to have to figure out,is it safe?Does it work in different age groups?How are we going to scale it up?All of that.But there are many others who are usingconventional vaccinology.An example would be, the Frenchare working on a measles-based vaccine.The idea is to put the spiked proteinin the measles vector,and it takes a little bit longerto do that work,but once you have that done, of course,we know how to make measles vaccine.We make hundreds and hundredsand hundreds of millions of dosesand provide it to the whole world.If that was to work,that might be easier to scale up.So I think what we want in the raceis to have multiple different vaccinesmoving forward.We don't want one or two.We don't want a hundredin the late stages,because it's expensive and hard to do.But we want to have a diversityof science approaches going forward.", "CA: Which of the other candidatesout there are you excited byor at least intrigued by?", "SB: Well, for me,the critical issue here is going to bewe have to optimize for speed,and so that means, as I said,having examples of allthe different new technologiesthat could potentially work,as well as conventional dosesmoving forward at the same time.So what you're going to want to dois have this bubble up.And it's not just companies,or big companies.It's also biotech companies.It's also academic researchersthat are working on this.You want all of those to bubble up.Then you want to be able to look atwhat's the most promising,and that will depend upon animal results.It'll depend upon being ableto produce those vaccines,have a pathway,and eventually, you will want to put thoseinto human clinical trials.That requires a certain amountof safety work.You can try to accelerate that.But then you need to say, OK,we need to know, do we need one dose,do we need multiple doses,do we need 50 micrograms, 100, 150?Do we need a chemical stimulantwe call an adjuvant?Given that this disease,its big problems in outcomesare in the elderly,we might need to put some stimulants into make it a more potent immune response.So all of that work has to go on.That's what the clinical testing is.Eventually you say, \"Aha!Here's the vaccine we're going to use.\"Now you test it in an efficacy trial.And that is to see, does it work?And at that point,you then have a vaccinethat you know works.But there is a stage after that,and that stage is, you've gotto work out the manufacturing,have it all worked outso that the regulators knowthat you can really make this,and that it's pure,it doesn't have any problems with it.And during that period,and that's what we did in Ebola,we were able to use those vaccinesto help in outbreaksunder a clinical trial protocolwhile monitoring them and learning.So there's a lot of steps there,and it's complicated,and I've shortened it a little bit.", "CA: But summarize the stepsthat they basically need to go through.I heard probably an animal test,and then --", "SB: Well, for example, Moderna.They went into humans at the same timethey're doing animal testing.We don't have a perfect animal model.But normally it takes10 to 15 years to do this,and that's the compressionyou're trying to do here.So the challenge is, we can compressall those different clinical trials.The basic way you think about it is,preclinical studies, animals,understanding it, purity, reproducibility.Then you move into human studies.You start off with a small numberof healthy people.You then work on the dosing,how much, how often.Then you move into peopleat risk for the disease --that might be in this case the elderlyor people with other conditions --and then eventually do an efficacy trial.Now, one of the cool newthings we can do todayis something called\"adaptive trial design.\"So rather than do these sequentially,what you can begin to do is enroll peopleand then, as you get the data you need,you can just begin to bring inthe next set of groups,and by doing that,you can speed it up dramatically.", "CA: When you say enroll people,you mean enroll peoplewho have their eyes wide open.They have informed consent.I think that's the term.", "SB: Absolutely.", "CA: And they're willing to,I guess, take the riskthat this isn't a fully tested vaccinebut it may well be efficacious,and so that obviously can help a lot.That's crucial to this, right?", "SB: Absolutely. They arethe unsung heroes of vaccinology,because people go out,they volunteer to take a substance,particularly early on,that don't know how it's going to react.Is it going to make the diseaseworse? Make it better?Is it going to protect them?Is it going to make them sick?So you try to predict thatif you can with animals,but people do do that,and the informed consent saysnot only you may havethese side effects or these problems,but also this vaccine may not work.And so it's importantfor people to understand that,because you don't want peopleto go and put themselves at high risk,saying, \"Oh, gee, I had a vaccine,and so I'm protected.\"We don't know that untilwe get to the efficacy stage of trials.", "CA: But Seth, even puttingtogether all those dots,what I've heard most people sayis that it is likely to takeat least 18 monthsbefore the world will havea vaccine availableat any kind of scale.Is that time line right?And can the world remotely afford18 months on this?", "SB: Well, I think, you know,I've given you many questions.I could raise lots more questions.So part of it's going to be luck:How easy is this particularcandidate vaccine going to be?How lucky will we be in gettinga good immune response?Which approaches will work?Will they be scalable?So I think there's lot of questions there.The world will do everythingthey can to squeeze it down,but I think that's the time linewe're talking about.And remember, it's 10 to 15 years usually.In the case of Ebola, we did itin five years to a licensed product.In this case, we are hopingto squeeze it down dramatically,but there are many thingswe're going to have to go through,and it's really about making surethat vaccine works and it is safe for usein what ultimatelymay be billions of people.", "CA: Whitney.", "WPR: Hi. So we havelots of questions coming in, Seth.One of them that's kind ofrelated to this is, you know,a lot of us right now are isolating,and we're not buildingour exposure to this virus,so how will that affect usin the long term?Will this make us vulnerableto the virus until a vaccine is available?", "SB: So that's a great question,and, as you know,we don't fully understandthe epidemiology of this virus,but there is some sensethat there may be asymptomatics.Do they get immune protection?Are they afterwardsresistant to infection?We don't know that, but we do knowthat people do get sick,including young people,and that sickness can be quite severe.Obviously, a lot of it is mild,but some of it is quite severe,and then it gets more severein the elderly.So I wouldn't recommendthat anybody go outand intentionally try to getexposed to this virus now.The whole idea of having isolation nowis to try to stopthe chains of transmission,protect health workers in hospitals,with the idea being that if youcan suppress it enough --and Bill talked about thisin his talk --and later on have testing available,you might be able to go backto somewhat of a normal lifeand then watch forreintroduction of this virus.Of course, at the end of the day,we will probably need a vaccineto be able to completely control that,but the experiment is going on,in China ...Japan has done an amazing jobof controlling thiswith slightly less severe interventions.We've seen in Korea similar things.So the hope would be thatif we take it seriously,we actually damp down the exposuresand stop this epidemic now,we'll be able to removeto some form of normalcy.And we also may have drugs,and drugs will changethe dynamics as well,because people will then know that theyare able to get treatment as well.", "WPR: Great. I'll be back laterwith other questions I'm seeing.", "SB: Thanks, Whitney.", "CA: Thanks, Whitney.Thanks everyone watching.Keep those questions coming.Seth, this time line,I've been puzzled about this,because I get thatthere are so many thingsthat have to be checked out,but I still worrythat the rules are notadapting rapidly enoughfor the scale of the emergency.I mean, my analogy would be:you're going about your lives,and suddenly there's this emergency,you see that there's this enemy forceapproaching you from the horizonand coming your direction.You don't, in that circumstance,spend a week trying to test all your gunsand make sure they're operatingabsolutely safely and in the right way.You galvanize and you do takesome additional riskfor the sake of avoiding the bigger risk.Is that thinking prevalent right now?Are there people tryingto make those kinds of trade-offs?How should we think about that?Or do you really believethat the community is galvanizingand moving forwardas fast as it humanly canand appropriately balancing the two risks?", "SB: I think we're seeing heroicsin moving forward here.Obviously, you're right, and the reasonwe talk about going from 10 to 15 yearsdown to something like 18 monthsis about squeezing those stepsas much as possible.The regulators in the Ebola experiencewere really fabulous.They worked with usand tried to keep any bureaucratic delaysdown to the smallest amount possible.And I think that's what's goingto be important here,is we have to look at every single stepand say, \"Is it critical?\"But you do need to answera lot of these questions.For example, if you have a vaccinethat works in healthy people,it very well may not givean immune response to the elderly.We may need to change that vaccineto make it work there.It may not work in young children.So you need a certain amountof studies done.Of course, if you work in areasthat have big outbreaks,you're able to also enroll more quicklyand follow people more quickly.That's one of the reasonswe'll have to think about this globally,because we don't know in 12 to 18 months,or even six to 18 months,if we're really lucky,where the epidemic will be raging andwhere we want to do the clinical trials.We should be prepared to do themwherever in the world it's possible,and also do somein different types of countries.Developing countries may havedifferent immune responsesthan in wealthy countries.", "CA: What alarms me a bitis that on the models I've looked at,with the possible exceptionof what happened in China and Japan,by distancing, we can bend the curve,we can reduce infection.But as soon as you go back to normal,there's this huge riskof a massive resurge,and until the vaccine comes along,it feels like your choices are:one, sort of recklessly exposethe whole population to the bugand develop some kind of herd immunity,or try and do this scary danceof really cramping down on the economyand all the risksthat are associated with that,and risking, if you lift the lid on that,risking these really dangeroussecond surges.So is that the right wayto think about it?There's a scenario where,until this happens,and if it's 18 months,that's an incredibly long timefor the world to bein that sort of dangerous, scary dance.", "SB: Well, I think the issue here is thatis a little bit the way to think of it,but the experiment is going on now.China is now releasing its controls,and we will see what happens there.We'll see where they haveto clamp back downand what's going to happen,and we'll get a good ideaof what that's like.Right now, in many countries,we're still in the upscale periodwhen we're seeing lots of cases.And so we have to breakthat transmission firstbefore we can have that conversation.I'm the first person that would likea vaccine to occur quicker,and, of course, my jobis to underpromise and overdeliver,not the other way around.And I think we have to be carefulnot to think about,\"Oh, we can just have a vaccinein a couple of months.\"It may be that we're lucky.It may be that it's easy to do.It may be the first few candidateswill show promise,we get efficacy, we can scale those upfor at least some limited usewhile it's being worked out.But a lot of things haveto fall in place for that to happen.And that's why we want to havean organized, global effortto absolutely incentivizethe best possible chancefor that to happen in the fastest way.", "CA: There's some kind of debate out thereabout whether there might beway, way more cases,mild cases, basically zero-symptom casesof coronavirus out therethat may have granted more peopleimmunity than we know.Is that a credible suggestion?More cases and much lowerfatality rate than we know,because so many of the casescould be invisible?", "SB: You know, Mayor Bloombergused to have a saying that I loved.He said, \"In God we trust.Everybody else, bring data.\"And I think the answer hereis we haven't done enough testing to know,and we started out with PCR teststo look for virus,and therefore, if you had recovered,didn't have the virus anymore,we weren't able to pick it up.Now there are beginningto be antibody teststo look to see if you've been exposedand don't have the virus nowbut have an immune response to it.Once we have those testsoperating at scale,we'll be able to understandwhat the epidemiology isand what's happening,and then we'll be in a much better placeto understand how this is playing out.Also, I mean, even the question:We don't see a lot ofcases in children --is that because the children get infectedbut they don't get symptoms,and therefore they might bepotential spreaders?Or, is it because those childrendon't get it at all?", "CA: So tell us, Seth, about this callthat you issued yesterday.I mean, you've said that scientistsare behaving heroically.But you've called for something more herefrom both scientists,companies, governments.Tell us what your call is.", "SB: So, first of all, I believethat, given the situation here,this is not the time to just letthe normal system work,as we've talked about.I think we have to think about vaccinesas a global public good.And what that means is that initially,it ought to be public sector financed.Obviously, if others wantto contribute resources,I believe they should, fine.But we want to make surethe best approaches come,and it doesn't matterwhere they come from in the world.We want to make sure if the best approachis in China or Japan or in South Koreaor in the US, wherever it comes from,whatever company has the ideas,get them on the table.Then we want a processto say, realistically,how are these being compared?How do we decide which onesare most likely to succeed?And then, as I explained,some diversity in taking those risks.Maybe some new technology,some old technologies to drive forward.Once that happens, then,to try to get clinical trialsto drive forward as quickly as possible.Now, the delay here is actuallylikely to be in manufacturing,because we might wantbillions and billions of doses,so how do we then begin to invest,at risk, in manufacturing plants?If it's a big company, they may haveadequate manufacturing,but we may want to workwith contract manufacturers,other companies, or even build plantsor use new technologies,modular technologies to do this.And then, of course, at the endis going to be the processof getting the vaccine outto all those who need it,and that's going to need to bedependent upon the risk at that time.", "CA: Help me understand this better, Seth,because right now, it feels likethere's this huge effort going on,but companies are operating,in a way, competitively with each other.To an extent, countries are operatingcompetitively with each other.Are you saying that what the world needsis some kind of widely supportedglobal -- I don't know -- vaccine czarthat is pulling togetherdifferent efforts,coordinating, encouraging everyoneto work together for the common good,and trying to get agreementon these big decisionslike what are the smartfew candidates to get behind,rather than this confusing explosion?And then, how do wecoordinate manufacturing, etc?Like, is that a personor a small organizationthat some combination of governments,WHO, UN needs to put together?", "SB: So, first of all, you want scienceto bubble up at the beginning.You don't want to havecentralized control,somebody saying, \"I know bestand I'm going to predict this.\"So you want it bubbling upfrom all over the place,but then you want a coordinated effort.The group that is best-placed to do thatis the World Health Organization,maintaining a list of allthe different programs that are going on.We also have other organizations.I mentioned CEPI before.CEPI has now supportedeight different candidates.I think it's going to support more.Right now, WHO hason its list 44 candidates,but some people thinkas many as double that.So what you want to do is say,which are the most likely to succeed,and then put them throughsome type of standardized set of criteriato pick a few of them to move forwardaggressively for the world.Obviously, science is goingto keep moving,they're going to keep changing,and it may be that your original approachisn't right and new ideas may come up,but you do need to have some processof moving this forward.And really, that's what I called for.What we need to make sure is thatif companies have adequate resourcesto do this on their own,that's fine,but if not, they need to be supportedby the public sectorand, again, making sure there's adequatemanufacturing and ultimately distribution.Then, after a period of time,we can go back to normaland return to the normal wayvaccines are handled.But I think that's probablythe best way to get there.", "CA: How much might this cost,and who should pay for it?", "SB: Well, it dependshow many cases there are.The good news is, we're talking now abouttrillions of dollars in economic loss,and this is going to be --", "CA: I would hardly call that good news.", "SB: I mean, I'm making the comparison.Sorry, you're absolutely right, Chris.I mean, we're talking abouttens of billions of dollars here,not trillions of dollars,and the reason that's important isyou want to make sure that any good ideahas its best chance of moving forward,and we ought to, again,optimize for speedand not optimize for beingcost-effective at this time.", "CA: So I guess you're saying that, like,the rich countries may well be ableto afford some kind of vaccine program.I think what I hear you doing hereis representing a lot of the countriesthat can't afford it,and what you're saying is that the worldmay have to find a wayof spending tens of billions of dollarsto avoid trillions of dollarsof economic damageand all the hardship that goeswith it around the world.Is that about right?", "SB: That's absolutely right,but I think the important point is,this needs to be a global perspective.I mean, look at what happened with Ebola.We had a vaccinethat was originally made in Canadaby the Public [Health] Agency of Canada.It was then transferred to a US biotech,then to Merck and Company,which is obviouslya global player based in the US,and they're manufacturing it in Germany.That's the way science works,and these vaccines may needcomponents from other places.So how do we think about thisin a global way and make sure that --By the way, the second vaccinethat's in humans is from China.Of course, they've had a lot of timeto work on it compared to some others.And they have a candidatethat's moving forward.If that candidate is successful,we want to make surethat's the one that's scaled up.And so for me, it's making surethat we're looking at thisas a global ecosystemwith the best candidates moving forwardfor the good of the world.", "CA: Whitney.", "WPR: We have a lot of peoplewatching from all over the worldand we're seeing questions,especially from some of our friendsin India who are watching,connected to this just basically abouthow are poor nationsgoing to get access to this vaccine?And then, specifically, when we thinkabout who gets the vaccine first,will there be some sort of paymentthat people are paying for this vaccineand those who can afford itwill get access before others?", "SB: Well, the decisionon who will pay for itwill ultimately comefrom the political leaders,and my recommendation would be,you start off as a global public good,you make the vaccine availablebecause we're trying to stop the epidemic.Later on, we can have tiered pricingin different places.But one of the concerns, of course, is:Where is the epidemicgoing to be at that point,and who needs it first?I would argue that people that will needit first are probably health workers,because health workers are goingto be on the front linesand we want them to be thereto be able to take care of people.They're at risk of both contracting itas well as spreading it.Then you probably want to think aboutthe high-risk individuals,the elderly, people who havepreexisting conditions,and then eventually, the restof the population, if it's needed.So having some type of wayof thinking about that.We'll also need to be thinkingabout equitable access,and that is going to meanthinking about the entire world.Now, Gavi, in the past,including in India,has worked to make surethese new technologies are there,but these are vaccines that existedand, in this case, it's a new vaccine.We have to make sure that it isn't hoardedonly in wealthy countriesor in a select set of countries.And one way to do that would be to havevaccine production in multiple places.So today a lot of the vaccinesthat Gavi uses are made around the world.Some are made inthe United States and Europe,but some are made in South Korea,in India, in China, in other countries.And so what we could do is have a vaccinetransfer the technology and manufacturingin multiple different sitesso we could have enough vaccinefor that original launch.But whatever happens,there will always be a period of timewhen we'll have an exciting vaccineand not enough doses to go around,and that's when we needto take hard decisionsbased upon science on who should get it.", "WPR: Thanks for that, Seth.I'll be back later with other questions.", "CA: Thanks, Whitney. SB: Thank you.", "CA: How confident are youthat we'll eventually get one?I mean, we still don't havea vaccine for HIV,nor for the common cold.How can you be confidentthat we can get one this time?", "SB: Well, first of all, as you know, I dida TED Talk even before the one of 2015talking about HIV and fluand how new science needs to come in,and frankly, we are making progressagainst some of theseincredibly difficult organisms.You talked about variability.That's the problem with HIV.It's constantly changing,and so you're chasing.You get a good immune response,but it's to the strainthat was there before,and now you're chasing new strains.There are ways to work around that.It's new science.I, actually, I am optimistic.I'm optimistic because we havesome experience with SARS vaccinesand with MERS vaccines,and so people have worked on it.They've been able to get good immuneresponses in animals and in peoplefor those vaccines.And so we can build on that experience.I can't tell youhow long they'll last for,how effective they will be.Will they need to havelocal mucosal immunity,which is in the mouth and nose,as well as serum immunityin the bloodstream?Will they need to have just antibodiesor the other arm of the immune system,the cellular arm?These are questionsthat will need to be answered,but I am a great believerin the power of science,and I think in this case the organismis not going to be quite as difficultas the ones you're talking aboutthat are much more difficult.", "CA: You mentioned in your TED Talkfive years ago, Seth,that we've got this situationwhere we're spending billions of dollarson nuclear submarinespatrolling the oceansfor a possible incoming threat,nuclear war threat or whatever,and almost nothing on preparation fora pandemic like the one we're suffering.If the world is adequately shaken upby what's happening nowand gets rational about this,what is the key structural shiftthat would be the pandemic equivalentof having those nuclear submarines?How do we prepare for a new virusthat we don't know what it will beor when it will come?How do we prepare to havea much more rapid response?", "SB: Well, it's a great questionand I think the TED communityhas a role to play here.So first of all, we needbetter surveillance.We need surveillanceeverywhere in the world,and that's why we don't wantto have another outbreaklike in West Africa with Ebola.You want to have a resilient health systemin every country that reachesout to the periphery.And that's an important priority.We're doing pretty good with immunization.We've reached 90 percentof the kids of the worldwith at least one dose of routine vaccine.That's the best of health interventions.But we need to reach that last 10 percentand put that health system in place.Then we need to have a different view.We need to start working,where are our likely hot spots?It's where we're cutting down forest.It's in urban slums,where there's density of populations.It's with climate changeand movement of different vectors.And what we need to dois use predictive science,and that's where big data can help,that's where AI can helpin terms of trying to do that.And we need to have a one-health approach,because we tendto think of animal diseases --and by the way, people have workedon coronavirus vaccines for animals,because they also cause disease there --we need to make sure that the scientistsworking on veterinary vaccinesare connected to humans, are thinkingabout those whole ecosystem.And we need to invest in that.And unfortunately, after an epidemic,everybody wants to invest,and they say, \"Whatever it takes,\"and then we move to on other things,and investments go down.What's different about the militaryis that there is a baseline of investmentthat goes on all the timeand nobody questions that.It continues, and that levelof preparedness seems to be there.Bill Gates in his talk in TED,when we did that back-to-back, said,look, the military are doing war games,they're constantly testing,they have all this preparatory activities.Why are we not doing that in diseases?And, as you know, since then,there has been some war games,and they've basically saidwe weren't prepared,and I think we're seeingnow that, in fact,we're not as prepared as we could be.So my hope, the silver lining would bethat we prepare for the next big outbreak,because it's absolutelyevolutionarily certainwe will continue to have outbreaks.The question is: How preparedare we to deal with those?", "CA: As we wait for a vaccine,are there other interventionsthat could be made,for example, the serum from peoplewho have been infected and have recovered?", "SB: So, that technique has been usedin other infectious diseasesand throughout historyand even in Ebola recently.That's something that couldpotentially be done.Of course, today, it's more attractive ifyou can make antibodies in the laboratoryand then have those available at scaleand use those,and I know of a lot of companies thatare working on producing those antibodies,which could be infusedin an emergency situation, and do that.Obviously, drugs may playan important role here.There's a similar effortto try to create drugsthat are active against this organism,and if we knew that you'd get sickbut there was an effective treatment,that would also changea little bit of the dynamicsof the fear that existsaround this pandemic.So I think there arelots of interventions.Of course, traditionally,a preventive vaccine is the best wayto deal with these types of epidemics.", "CA: So paint us -- it's the inneroptimist in me, begging for something --paint us the best case scenario, Seth.Lots of people are saying,we don't want to be huddled in our homesby ourselves for 18 months,lovely though the internet is.What's the best case scenario,putting all the pieces together here?", "SB: Well, I think what islikely to happen,but I don't want to predict,because we're in unprecedented times here.What's likely to happen is that countrieswho don't take this seriouslywill have severe outbreaks,those that really take it seriouslyand put these extraordinarymechanisms in placewill control the disease.It'll take some time, it'll take --you know, this is weeks, maybe months,not years, to do that.And then you end up with a situationwhere the disease is controlled,and you then can go back to life as normalwith some cautions around it.Now there's beginning to be new teststhat are going to be home tests.We're going to be able to figure outwhether classrooms, regions,countries have disease.We can go back to some level of normalcy,but one thing that's really importantis we can't have areas of the worldwith raging disease.So for example, if people said,\"Oh, we're not worried about Africa,we're only worried about our countries,\"you might end up in a situation whereyou have large numbers of infections,the virus is mutating,it's actually adapting to humans.We saw some of that with SARS.And then it is easy to reintroduce.So what you want to do is dampen it downeverywhere in the world.And maybe it'll burn out.Maybe that'll be it.I personally thinkwe'll probably need a vaccine,but best case scenario is that those alonewill stop the epidemic,and what we'll need is then a vaccinejust in case it comes back,but of course if I was a betting man,I'd say let's get a vaccineas soon as possible,because that's the best wayto control a viral infection,particularly onethat is spread respiratorily.", "CA: Yeah. It's so interestingwhat you said there.Like, the vaccine doesn't knowwhat continent it's on,what country it's in.It just does its thing.", "SB: That's correct.", "CA: So in terms of people listening here,what kind of psychological advicecan you give them?What should expectations be?Like, do we have to be readyto settle in for the long haul here,or should we be looking forwardto getting back to businessaround about Easter time and celebrating?", "SB: Well, again, I don't wantto put a time line on it like others do.What you're going to want to seeis that bending of the curve.I think Bill talked about this.You want the reproductive rate below one.You want to get itway below one if you can,and then to beginto see the disease spread.And what you don't want to dois, in the middle of that,jump out and start having parties.It's not time to go on spring breakand start mixing again.But with careful control,you can begin to release the controlsif that's what science shows us.And I think the most important thing hereis we need the data to tell us that.That's why testing is so important.With the wide availability of testing,we'll be able to keep tabs,know what's happening.We'll know how many peopleare asymptomatic, what's happened.We'll know wherethere are hot communities,and we'll be able to deal with this,is my prediction.So I don't think this isover a very, very long time,but I wouldn't rush itduring this unprecedented moment.Otherwise, we're going to end upseeing what we saw in Italy.What we're seeing in New York right nowis the overwhelming of the health system.", "CA: Yeah, no kidding.New York is a scary place right now.I was out walking today.I hope that was OK.But there was no one. There was no one.Like, you couldn't get within six feetof someone if you tried right now,on the busiest walk spots.That was nice to see,but man, it's startling.", "SB: I mean, recent data has shownthat droplets can spread the disease,and so people are rightfullybeing cautious.And we didn't know that.You remember when we started,we said it's a point outbreak,out of Wuhan, wet market,you had to be in the marketto get the disease.Then it was, if you were with sick people,you got the disease.Then it was maybe asymptomatics.I think as we understand better,that gives us the toolsto do the right thing.", "CA: There's a debate out there thatseems to be growing again about masks.The East and West takevery different advice on masks.We were hearing from Gary Liu yesterdaythat everyone in Hong Kong and Chinais basically wearing masks,and arguably, that has been effective.The advice in the Westagainst not wearing masks --how much of that has been driven by justthe fact that there's a shortage of masksand that if anyone needs to wear them,it's medical professionals?If it's water droplets, it seems likemasks could be effective in prevention.", "SB: I mean, the most importantintervention, as you know,is some isolation and very carefulhandwashing or use of sanitizers,because what happens is,you touch your face --I forget the number, I thinkit's like every one to two minutes --and you touch your eyes,so if you reach a door handleor you have contact with a surface,and we know the viruscan live on those surfaces,and then you touch your face,touch your mouth, touch your nose,you can spread it.So the purpose of a maskfor a person who is not infectedis not so much to keep themfrom getting infected.It is to keep themfrom touching their face.So I think what's interesting here is,how do we get peopleto have this personal sanitation?If we have unlimited quantities of masks,people want to do it as a wayto remind themselvesnot to touch their face.Now, that's very differentif you're infected,because if you're coughing,having a mask on does reducethe spread of droplets,and that's why they recommend itin a situation where somebody is infectedand has to go to the hospitalor has to go out and be seen.", "CA: Yeah, I was touching my faceall through the Bill Gatesinterview, apparently,and I got called to taskby our online friends,which was very nice.I don't know if I'vebeen doing that today.It's funny, you're unconsciousof it. It's weird.", "SB: Yes. No, it's automatic.And in fact, there was a WHOchallenge for safe handwashing,and I did a video, and I leftmy water running while I did it,and my friends in the developing worldcame to me and said,you know, I live in Switzerlandby a lake where we have a lot of water,and I wasn't careful,and they were absolutely right.So it's really good we correct each other,that's an important point,and help each other in doing thisto get us to be as compliantas we possibly can for these issues.Whitney.", "WPR: Yep. So feedback onlineis overwhelmingly positive.You're really answeringall of everyone's questions out there,and people really appreciatewhat you're sharing, Seth.I think one big question is justfor folks who are watching from homeand maybe who are not partof your communityin terms of the science community.How can they contributeto this global response effort?How can they do something to advance this?", "SB: That's a great question.So first of all, I think it's reallyimportant that citizens support leaderswho are following science,are using science,because, as you know,sometimes political leaders say,\"Well, I don't want to do thisbecause it's not good for my imageor it's not good for the economyor it's not good for whatever.\"And I think you want to haveall of your decisions taken by science,understanding that they'renot the best science.So, citizens need to applaud,even if it's a tough decisionthat politicians take for the goodbased upon science, that's a good thing.The second thingthat really would be helpfulis this concept: How do we keepour world focused on the factthat these epidemics will occur?Another example I didn't answer,which Chris, when he asked meabout what could be done,we talked about this ideaof platform technologies.These are vaccines that you can test,get them all ready,and then, when a new organism occurs,you can put it in thereand you know how to manufacture it,how to scale it up.These types of things can be done.CEPI is trying to do that now.But the challenge is,if we, a year after this,go down to having no moneyavailable for these types of issues,that will be a problem.So what you need is citizens to say,\"I understand nowthat health is precious,and I want my government, my leadersto invest in this, in the science,in the ways of workingso that we will be as safeas we can be going forward.\"And I think I can't emphasize enoughhow important a message that isfor citizens everywhere in the world.", "CA: Mmm.Hey Whitney, stay on as we wrap up here.I guess what I'd like to give youa chance to do, Seth,as we wrap this upis just to look at the cameraand make your call to the world's leaders,companies,politicians, scientists, citizens.How do we move forward?How would you wrap this up?", "SB: So from my perspective,what we need is the worldto come together at this moment,not to talk about our national programs,not to talk aboutour science are the best,and they may be the best,but how do we, as a world,pool our best science, our best resources,our best ways of working,our best manufacturing,our best clinical trials,to move this forward as fast as possible?The WHO is a global organizationwhose job is this normative function,and we can get scientists to help themmake sure that the normative functionis as strong as it can be.We can get the leadersof the world to come togetherand put the resources in place.Given the cost it's having on the economy,this will be a real bargainto invest in it.But what we need is to

scientistto my community.I said, you are giving the good weatherinformation through the TV and radio,but how about coming to my people?And then they come,they sit around,and suddenly, as we are nomadic,we just start packing our stuff,and then they say, like, \"Are we moving?\"I'm like, \"No, we are not moving.It's going to rain.\"And they're like, \"Oh, there's no cloud.How do you know it's

place that we moveduring each season.And these tools are amazing,because it's building capacity of women,because in our communitieswomen and men cannot sit together.Men talk always, women just sitting there,but in the back.They are not there to take any decision.So after the men figure outall the knowledge,we say, well, you call the women,\"Come and have a look.\"They say, \"Yes, sure,\"because

virtual TED teamscattered around New York,currently one of the epicentersof this pandemic.So it's definitely a scary timefor people here.I'd like to welcome to join memy cohost here,Whitney Pennington Rodgers.She's our current affairs curator.", "Whitney Pennington Rodgers:We're going to be looking a little bitat China's response today.When news surfacedabout a strange viral outbreakin Wuhan, Chinaat the very last days of 2019,I think a lot of people were confusedabout what was going on there,and in the months that followed,we learned more about the diseasethat's now known as COVID-19,we watched the situationin China quickly worsenand in the most recent weeksdramatically improve.And I think as all of us around the worldgrapple with how we can containand control the spread of COVID-19,there are a lot of lessons we can learnfrom what China experiencedand how they responded.So we're really thrilledto be joined todayby the CEO of the \"South ChinaMorning Post,\" Gary Liu,who's here to sharehis perspective and insights.So, welcome Gary.", "Gary Liu: Thanks for having me.", "WPR: Hey there, Gary,thanks for being with us.And I think before we dive into things,I'd love to hearabout just how things have beenfor you personally,your loved ones, those close to you,how have you been experiencing this?", "GL: It's complicated.So we're here in Hong Kong,I'm working from home,like much of Hong Kong.I'm actually self-quarantinedin our apartment here in Hong Kong,because there was a confirmed casein our workplace.So over the course of the last week plus,and likely for at least another week plus,the entire organizationhas been distributedand working from home.", "You know, when Hong Konggot its first confirmed case,I was actually backin the United States with my wife,we were taking a small breakin the Rockies,and we came back to Hong Kongpretty soon after thatto make sure we got back into Hong Kongbefore the airports shut.And at that point,it was all of our familyin the United States and friendstexting us and worryingabout how things were in Hong Kongas the situation in Chinastarted escalating,and people were sending us,or trying to send us, supplies.Masks and sanitizer and stuff like that.And now it's the opposite.New York City is our home,so we certainly empathizewith what you guysare dealing with right nowand going through in the city.And we are seeingour friends and our familyback home in New York and in Californiaand checking in on them,trying to send equipmentand materials back to them,so the script has flippedactually pretty fastover just the last couple of weeks.", "WPR: And you know,I think that's actuallya really interesting place to startand probably a question that a lotof people who aren't in China have,you know, I thinkfrom the outside looking in,it seems as if what's happened in Chinais kind of miraculous.That to go from, you know,you have a country with morethan a billion people there,to go from as many as 80,000 casesto nearly zero new cases now,you know, what can you tell usabout how this happened,to help us understandthe current situationand just really how China ended up there?", "GL: Yeah, a lot has happened.China has been dealing with thisfor several months now.Several-month head start,that's not a good thing,but they have gone throughseveral different phases.I think, Whitney, before I jump into it,there are a couple of caveatsthat are really important to make.The first one is that we're stillparsing what happened in China.The information system, as everyone knows,is still relatively closed.And so a lot of the informationthat we're usingto piece together what happened in Chinais still not fully complete.And so with every passing day,every passing week,there's more informationthat allows us to retroactivelymake sure that we get the pictureof what happened early onin those early daysat the end of 2019,get that picture right.And there's still a lotthat's happening today,even though I thinkthe information sharingis much more open than it was early on,there's still a lot of stuffthat we need to parse.", "And the second important caveat hereis that I think learningsometimes suggeststhat everything China didwas right and good,and hopefully, other countriescan take it and apply it,but that's not 100 percent the case.China, of course,did a lot that was right,and if we walked through the time line,I think it would be pretty apparentthe decisions that they madekept the coronavirusfrom really explodingacross the entire countryand really limited it to one provinceand mostly one city.But there were also many, many missteps,and those are things that I thinkthe world can also learn from,most importantly, China should learn from,because most of these --I think those of uswho are professional observerswould call missteps,are because they are systemicissues with the country,because of governance,lack of free information flow,stuff like that.Those are the initial caveats,but I think the timingof how China progressedfrom first case to nowhas been fascinating.", "WPR: Yeah, and I mean,so we know now that in Hubei provincethey've officially liftedthe two-month lockdown.And are you getting the sense,do you feel like this is the rightdecision to make at this moment?", "GL: I don't think I'm the right personto say whether or notit's the right decision.But certainly, this has beena progression of decisions,and I think they've been sittingon this decision for quite some time.Wuhan itself, which waswhere the pandemic started,it was the first epicenterand the major epicenter.Wuhan is opening up on April 8,that's right now the schedule.And this is really, what we're in nowis the third of three phasesfrom the first discoveryof the virus in Wuhan.Now, April 8 will be about 11 weeksafter Wuhan the citygot completely shut down,and the Hubei province got shut down.And so for those who arein a shelter, at homekind of situations right nowin the United Statesand wondering how longthis is going to take,in Wuhan, they've beenlocked down for 11 weeksand only now has the Chinesegovernment decidedthey're ready to start letting peoplemove freely around.", "WPR: And to your point earlierabout some of the possible misstepsin terms of reporting,I mean, there are still reports nowthat we might not be gettingan accurate number of casesthat we're seeing in Wuhan or beyond,we're hearing some people saythere are no new cases,other people sayingthat there actually are cases.So do you feel like there isaccurate spread of informationabout the current state of the virusin China right now?", "GL: Generally, yes,with the caveat that it is basedon the Chinese government's definition.And this is one of the problems right nowthat even the World HealthOrganization is struggling with,is that the definitionof what is a confirmed case,what is an infection,is different from country to country.As an example, in China,the folks that have tested positivebut are asymptomatic,we understand nowthat they are not included,since February 7,they have not been includedin the official numbers.Or at the very least, on February 7,they changed that definition,and they're not includedin those official numbers.And that could be another 50 percenton top of the numbersthat we're seeing today.So what we've found,our reporters have gotten their handson some classified government documentsand government datathat suggests that a third of totalactual positive tests are asymptomatic,and therefore not includedin official numbers.Now, I don't think that this is an exampleof the Chinese governmenttrying to hide information.This is a definitions issue,which countries have been debatingand people are doing it in different ways.But like I said,there really have beenthree very distinct phases.We are in the third phasethat I would call recoveryand rehabilitation,rehabilitation beingthe rehabilitation of China's image.But the first part was discoveryand a lot of denial.And then there was thistwo-and-a-half-month periodof response and containment.And that I think,the response and containment partis the most interestingto the rest of the world.", "WPR: And so maybe we can breaksome of that down,you know, thinking about China's response.What were some of the specific thingsthat you think China did right,both as a nation,individuals in the country,what were some of the thingsthat you saw that worked really well?", "GL: OK, so let me walkthrough the time line,I want to try and get these dates right,because the dates do matter,I think again, for context,how many weeks it tookfrom one step to another.Let me actually back upinto that initial first phase,that discovery and denial phase.", "The first time we heardabout the coronavirus,this mysterious respiratory diseasethat looks somewhat like SARS,was on December 30.That was the day that there was a doctor,whose name is known all over the worldfor the unfortunate reasonhe ended up eventually dying,named Li Wenliang.And Li Wenliang, Dr. Li,posted to a private WeChatgroup on December 30.These were some of his oldclassmates from med school.And he said, \"Hey, I'm in Wuhan,I'm at the hospital,there is a SARS-like illness,\"SARS being the epidemic from 2002 to 2003,\"There's a SARS-like illnessthat is spreading throughthese hospitals in Wuhan.\"A private message.Somebody forwarded it,and it went viralacross the Chinese internet.The very next --so that was the first timewe actually heard about somethingthat was going on in Wuhan.The very next day, December 31,was the first timethat any Chinese officials --and on that day,it happened to be the actualprovincial and the city officials --acknowledged that there were 27 people,at that moment in time,who had been diagnosedwith this mysterious pneumonia,and they reported the casesto the World Health Organization.That was also the daythat Dr. Li was reprimanded,officially reprimanded.", "So that was really the discovery,the end of the discovery and denial phase,because what we know nowis that back to mid-December,several weeks before Dr. Liwrote his blog post,the authorities had already been notifiedthat a SARS-like pneumoniawas showing up in Wuhan hospitals.And action had already starteddown the chain of authority.They have now backdated,at least publicly backdated,the first case to December 1.But actually, in their confidentialand classified government documentsthat again, our journalists have seen,and we've published a story --Officially, in classified documents,they've backdated the first COVID-19 caseall the way back to November 17,as the earliest example that they can findbased on symptomsand based on retroactive diagnosisfor a COVID-19 case.So in effect, there were several weeksbefore the acknowledgmentto the World Health Organizationthat that was going on,and the first case with symptomswas actually identifiedabout a month and a halfbefore that noticeto the World Health Organization.", "Then the second phase,which really started,let's say, December 31,when the acknowledgment happened,was response and then massive containment.Now this phase, to be clear,still had some denialand a good amount of censorshiphappening within the country.So on January 1,the World Health Organizationstarted working with Chinaon trying to identify the virusand trying to figure out course of action.It wasn't until several weeks laterthat Beijing, the central government,for the first time broke its silence,and that was on January 18.And actually, they broke the silenceto deny that this was SARS,and in fact to \"defy rumors\"that were spreadingaround the Chinese internet.", "But there was a major datethat happened two days afterwards,which was January 20.Because for the first time,a member of the party,a senior government officialwho is now one of the central gentlementhat is actually leading the task forceagainst COVID-19,his name is Zhong Nanshan,he's an epidemiologist,he was one of the central figuresduring SARS 17 years ago.On January 20, he visited Wuhan.And he admitted, for the first time,that human-to-humantransmission was possible.Now this was important,because prior to that,officials who had spoken uphad said that human-to-humantransmission was not likely,was not possible.And previous to that,all of the cases,the majority of the caseswere tied to this seafoodand wildlife marketplacethat was in the city of Wuhan.But now, on January 20,human-to-human transmission,it's possible, it's happening,and so of course, the course of action,not only in China,but the course of actionall over the world,started to change.And three days after that,Wuhan was locked down.It was completely, I mean,it shocked the worldthat they could lock downthat many people so quickly.Of course, now India yesterday announcedthat 1.3 billion peopleare being locked down.So we have another frame of reference now.", "And then the endof this middle second phaseI think really came in March,around March 10.Actually, on March 10 I should say,because Chinese president,Xi Jinping, visited Wuhan.And these things, in Chinese politics,because everythingis so well-choreographed,matters a whole lot.The fact that Xi Jinping visited Wuhansignaled that the Chinese governmentbelieved the worst was over.The reality was that probablyabout 20 days before that,the curve had already been flattened.So 20 days before that,probably around February 20,the infection ratewas around 75,000, 76,000,and it's effectively stayedwithin a couple of thousand since then.So on March 10,Xi Jinping's visit to Wuhankind of signaled the worst is over,and then they moved intothe recovery and rehabilitation phase.", "WPR: OK.I mean, if I'm hearing correctly --thank you for sharing all of that,it sounds like, althoughthere was a slow periodof getting the information out initially,eventually there was quick reactionfrom the Chinese governmentto respond to this, lock folks down.And it seems like that hada real impact on flattening the curvein China, in Wuhan.", "GL: A real impact.", "WPR: Yeah and I --", "GL: Absolutely.", "WPR: Yes, please go ahead, Gary.", "GL: The date of January 23was not by coincidence.Because the Chinese New Year holidaystarted on January 24,the very next day.And the thing is,with the Chinese New Year holiday,is that it is, every single year,it's the largest human migrationthat happens on Earth.About 400 million people travelduring about a forty-day periodthat would have started on January 24.And that's three billion trips,it's just people travelingall over the country,400 million people traveling.Now, Wuhan is one of the mostimportant cities in China,although before this,I don't think a lot of peoplearound the world knew the city of Wuhan,but it's extremely important.It is considered the most important cityin the center of Chinafor many different reasons,but one of the key reasonsis that it is one of the keytransportation hubs of the country.So all of the major train lines,the high-speed train lines,the normal train lines,the trade lines,they all kind of converge on Wuhan.So you can imagine if 400 millionpeople start moving aroundfor Chinese New Year on January 24,a huge number of themwere going to go through Wuhan.And of course, Wuhan itselfis an 11-million-person city.The surrounding cities all added together,Hubei provincehas about 60 million people,and they were also largelygoing to travel.And so if January 23they had not shut it down,and people had started traveling,the likelihood would have beenthat this would have beenreally, really hard,possibly, likely impossible to contain.And even though they shut down beforethe Chinese New Year holiday started,we now also know that at leastfive million people actually leftthe surrounding areas and traveled.Which is one of the reasonswhy it did spread a little bitacross the country,and then eventually spreadto other parts of the world.", "WPR: And I'd like to come backto that as well,just thinking aboutthe five million people who leftand sort of where they landed todayand how that affected things,but before we do that,I'm interested to talk with youa little bit more about --you mentioned this November dateas one of the earliest casesyou discovered that was reportedwas in November,and that's something actuallythat I hadn't heard before,and I imagine that might benews to a lot of people hearing this,and so I'm curious,when you think about the misstepsfrom China's perspective,in terms of what China did,you know, there is, as you mentioned,suppression of information is one thing,one major criticismof how China handled this.And hearing that maybe there was knowledgeof something as early as November,if that might have played a rolein how we were able to controland contain this a lot sooner.", "GL: I do want to clarify,from what we understand,officials were not notified about thisuntil mid-December.It wasn't --So it was really a couple of weeksbetween officials realizingthat there was a SARS-like pneumoniagoing aroundto when the first case was reportedto the World Health Organization.It wasn't all the way back to November 17.That was retroactively backdated,but that has not been made publicby the government.We published itbecause we've seen the datathat actually backdates the first case.From a misstep point of view,again, it's a couple of weekscompared to what happened in SARS,which was a long timeof locking down on information.This was much shorter,the period of time that the governmentwasn't in complete shutdown mode.But then, after that, of course,there was still continuedcensorship on the internet,especially withinthe Great Firewall of China,for communicationsbetween Chinese citizens.And you know, surprisingly to some,I think for a lot of China watchersnot so surprisingly,is that the government has --the central government --over the course of the last several weeks,actually, I should say probablythe last two months,has started to change their toneand to some degree admitthat there needed to bebetter free flow of information.They've changed the official narrativeof a couple of different things,including this initialwhistleblower, Dr. Li,who unfortunately ended uppassing away from the virus,they actually now refer to himas a national hero,they have officiallyremoved the reprimand,the Wuhan police have apologizedto Dr. Li's family,and they have actually been --a couple of policemen --have been punished in Wuhanfor the way that theyhandled the situation.So there has definitely beenan internal shiftand there is a lot moresharing of data and information.I can tell you,from Hong Kong's point of view,without the open sharing of informationbetween the authorities,between Hong Kong and mainland China,I think Hong Kong's responsewould have been much more differentand I think Hong Kong would havesuffered because of that.So that much moreopen sharing of informationhas benefited this city for sure.", "WPR: And we have Chris herewho has a question,I think, from the audience.", "CA: Hey, Gary.The online audience,loving what you're saying.It's so interesting,you're giving usamazing new insights here.Just in the current situationwhere much of --you know, there have beenthese very few reports of new cases.How much does it feellike life is getting back to normal?Do people really believe that this problemhas been successfully tackled elsewhere?", "GL: I think the sentimentin mainland Chinais that yes, in China,the problem has been tackled.And people are looking forwardto going back to normal life.A lot of the other major cities,Shanghai, Beijing,are starting to get back to work.Many of the factorieshave now been reopened.The last stat that I sawwas that 90 percent of the businessesthat had been shut downare now reopened in China.So generally speaking,life is getting back to normal.Wuhan and Hubei are really the last placesthat are still shut down,with Wuhan being the citythat is shut down until April 8.Hong Kong is a little bit different.Hong Kong has actually gone backinto a second waveof social isolation and distancing.A bunch of differentcompanies, us included,as well as the Hong Konggovernment and the civil servicehas now gone back to work from home.And it's because weare starting to see a second wave,but for us, honestly, is the first timethat we've had a spike of infections,and it's because of imported cases.It's because a lot of Hong Kong residentswho left Hong Kong prior to,well, actually when the virusfirst came into the city,are now returning, because oddly enough,the places they escaped toare now more dangerous than Hong Kong.And as they're coming back,a lot of them are actually bringingthe virus back with them.And so we're starting to see a spike.Before this week, the highestinfection day that Hong Kong hadduring the first two months of thiswas 10 infections in one day.Now the highest that we've seenin the last week was 48.So this is really the first spikethat we're seeing,and so Hong Kong is returning backto a state of alertness,to a state of caution,and more and more peopleare holed up at home.", "CA: Is it possible, in mainland China,that because of this redefinitionthat you spoke about,where if someone tests positive,but they're not showing symptoms,that is not reported as a case.That seems significant to me.Is that part of the explanationfor why new reports have gonenearly to zero?", "GL: I don't knowif that's the answer to it,but I do actually think that even with --and remember, these are folksthat are tested,so the data that we haveis that these folks have been tested,the tests have come back positive,but have not been addedto the official number of infections,because they're asymptomatic.But they have still gonethrough the processthat is part of China'scontainment strategy,which has worked extraordinarily well.Which is, first of all,lots and lots of people have been tested.And then once --if there is a positive test return,regardless of whether or notthey're symptomatic or asymptomatic,regardless of whether or notthey're added to official numbers,what happens nextis that they are quarantined,they're isolated,and contact tracing happens.Contact tracing is a key, key, key action.And so they go and figure outwhere this person has been moving,where they've been,who they've been in contact with,and all those folks that they've beenin close contact with,they get tested.And if they come backwith a positive test,then they're also isolatedand they go through the process again.So China has not been testing people,finding that they're asymptomaticand then just releasing themand letting them go home.That's not the case.", "WPR: I think to that point too,Gary, what you mentionedabout this trace-testingand being able to figure outwho people have been in contact withto figure out who may alsohave been infected,you know, when you lookat what's happeningin other parts of the world,you hear in the United States,where Chris and I are based right now,you're hearing that peoplewho are experiencing symptoms,have symptoms cannot get tested.You know, how does China's abilityto test so many peopleaffect the way that they can respondto this and control this virus?", "GL: It really matters.Without the significant testingand without the contact tracingthat comes afterwards,I don't think there's a waythat China could have contained itthe way that they did.The same thing here in Hong Kong.If we didn't have both of those,as minimum requirementsin a health system,Hong Kong could not have contained it.And this is actually the reason whySouth Korea is the onlyother country besides Chinathat has managed to flatten the curve,is because they aggressively tested.I think by far the highestper capita testinganywhere in the world,as far as we know right now.And they aggressively did contact tracing.And because of that, even thoughSouth Korea had this huge spike,and we thought that it wasgoing to get out of hand,they were able to suppress it, control it,and now they'rein a much, much better place.", "WPR: One thing you mentioned earlierthat I'd love to talk about, too, is SARSand the impact of going through thatin 2002 and 2003 for China,other countries in Asia, Hong Kong.You know, what effect did that haveon everyone's preparednessin that part of the worldfor the COVID-19 outbreak?", "GL: It was significant.I think the institutionaland social memory of SARSmatters a heck of a lot,when you look at China,Hong Kong, South Korea,Singapore, Taiwan, Japan,a lot of these countries in Asiahave dealt with COVID-19.Let me use Hong Kong as an example,because it's the onethat I know the most intimately.But a lot of what I'm about to sayactually does applyto those other areas of Asia.", "So for context,SARS, November 2002 to July 2003,very, very similarcoronavirus to COVID-19,I think there's about an 80 percentsimilarity to those two viruses.The global infected numberwas a little over 8,000,774 deaths.So by percentage,deadlier than COVID-19 isbut far less infectious than COVID-19 is.Now here's why it impactedHong Kong so much,and why the memory is so deep,and actually it tells you a lotabout Hong Kong's reaction to COVID-19.Of the 8,000 infected,22 percent were herein the city of 7.5 million,and 40 percent, actually39 percent of the deaths,299 people died in Hong Kong.Thirty-nine percent of the global deathshappened in Hong Kong.And SARS did not start in Hong Kong,it was imported into Hong Kongfrom southern China.And so SARS, again, deep, deep memory,but it was a massive turning pointin the Hong Kong health care systemand also the social practices of the city.And let me walk throughsome of that impact,because you can actually still see it,even before COVID-19,you see it every day.The health care systemwas able to really, very quickly,ramp up in capacity,because of preparation post-SARS.", "So after SARS,the Hong Kong health care authoritiesstarted preparing for greater capacity,especially for infectious diseases.There were new health alert systems,warnings and treatmentprotocols put in place.I can tell you that a lotof folks that were here before SARSwill tell you that in Hong Kong hospitals,before SARS,it was actually rare to seeeven medical professionalswear face masks.And now surgical masks are ubiquitous,not only in hospitals,but across the entire city.Anytime, anywhere, it seems,especially right now.New channels of communication and dataand information exchange were opened upwith mainland Chinese authorities,and technology was implemented,including now a supercomputerthat actually does contact tracingin Hong Kong.You could trace the existenceof the supercomputerand this contact-tracing abilityback to changes that happened post-SARS.", "On the social side,there was also a huge change.The first thing I have to talk aboutis, of course, masks.Now, I know that there is still notconsensus everywhere in the worldabout whether or not masksactually help in this situation.I know that the World Health Organizationas well as governments like the US,as well as Singapore,say that only medical personnelas well as people who are actually sickand showing symptomsneed to be wearing masks.In Hong Kong, everyone wears masks.And the government,even though they flip-flopped a little bitduring this epidemic,the general,the guidance is that everyoneshould be wearing masks.That started in SARS.Ninety percent of Hong Kongersduring SARS wore masks,and that habit actually stayedwith Hong Kongers,and so generally speaking,even outside of the pandemic,when people are sick and coughing,you'll see them wear masks out in public.On top of that,there was -- it became systemic,or I should say systematic controlsfor hygiene in social and public spaces.So if you visit Hong Kong,again, before all of this happened,you would have noticed that public spacesare constantly being disinfected.One good example that everyone noticesis that when you go into an elevatorin public spaces, in buildings,they will either have one of two things,potentially both.They'll either have a sign that tells youhow often the elevator buttonsare disinfected,or there will be a plastic,piece of sticky plastic,like a plastic sheet over the buttonsso it effectively becomes a flat surface.", "When you eat out,Hong Kong is obviously famousfor its dim sum,and one of the most famous thingsabout Hong Kong dim sumare the dim sum carts,which are also very popularin New York's Chinatown, as an example.Those dim sum carts,they pretty much went away after SARS.And so most dim sum restaurantsthat you'll go to in Hong Kong now,the vast majority of them,you have to order off of a menu,you don't have public carts going aroundbecause of hygiene issues.In most nice Chinese restaurantsin Hong Kong nowyou will get, when you sit down,two pairs of chopsticks per person.And those two pairs of chopsticksare different colored,because one is used to grab foodfrom the center of the tableto your plate,and the other one is for youto take the food and put it in your mouth.And honestly, there are hand sanitizersand hand-washing noticesliterally everywhere,and this is just partof the social behavior after SARS.Safety protocols in offices,everyone knows how to shut down an officeand control traffic really well.Most major offices havetemperature-check machinesat the very least available,and then, of course, social distancing.", "People understandsocial distancing is important,and so the moment there was fearof what was happening across the border,naturally, people startedsocial-distancing activitiesand self-quarantine became pretty normal.So those are all the social thingsas well as the health system thingsthat kind of changed,and because of that,Hong Kong was able to reactreally, really fast,not just the government,not just the health authoritiesbut the people of Hong Kong,and I think that's the mostimportant part,is that the entire city,that the community reactedand went into this modewhere you wore masks,you washed your hands,you carried hand sanitizer,you stopped going to public places.", "WPR: I'm curious then,I think a lot of peoplewho are listening at homeand figuring out how can we applysome of those things here,and from where you sit,and when you see what's going onin other parts of the world,where maybe people are strugglingto make some of these changes.You know, what are someof the specific thingsyou think folks can adaptin their own cultures,in their own countries?", "GL: I think communication is a huge deal.If you talk to local Hong Kongers,they will likely opinethat the communicationfrom the Hong Kong governmenthas not been top notch.But thankfully, there have beenother authoritiesand certainly even justperson-to-person communicationhas been pretty strong.A lot of corporates have donean incredible job in Hong Kongin communicating very transparentlywith their employeesand insurance companieshave also been making availableall sorts of webinars and materialsand made it actually quite easyfor people to understandhow to get tested,where to get tested, who to get tested.And so that communication, I think,has centralized,to some degree, the messaging.In a city like Hong Kong,everyone generallybelieves the same thing,and what they believe is generally true.Of course, there's stillmisinformation issues,as there are everywhere.But I think, possiblyalso because of SARS,because over the course of the 17 years,a lot of the misinformationhas now been vetted,everyone knows what is true,so there is already,sort of, an internal radaror at least alarm bellfor things that seem to be wrong.So I think communicationis really important,from government, from corporatesanywhere in the world.And I think if there isa recommendation for health systems,I know getting tests is really difficult.One of the things that has madetesting in China and Hong Kongcertainly so effective,is that there is point-of-care testing,that still really doesn't exist,or at least doesn't existin volume in the US.And so they have to save these testsand only a certain numberof people can get tested,the triage systemthen becomes overflowing.Whereas here, generally speaking,everyone can get tested,and then of course, the contact tracing.Everyone knows that if somebodythat you've been in contact withtests positive,you're going to be called inby the hospital authoritiesand you're going to be tested,and then if you're positive,everyone you've been in contact withfor the last two weekswill also be called in.And people don't really see itas an annoyance,it's just what needs to be done.And I think because of that, again,the containment has been effective.", "WPR: Great. And we have a questionfrom Chris here.", "CA: Gary, it actually buildson the point you just made,people are puzzled online,how is it that China avoidedthe explosion of casesin big cities like Beijing, Shanghai,where people were coming there from Wuhan.How on earth did someof those cases not explode?Was it just down to reallydiligent contact tracing?", "GL: I think it wasa combination of things.First of all, the shutdownof Hubei province certainly helped.And then, the major citiesactually went into isolationand quarantine as well.Remember, it was Chinese New Year,so there was no one working that week.And so everyone just went home.And generally speaking,in most major cities,they locked their doorsand they didn't leave.Now, China is very prepared for this,because the technology stack in China,including consumer site services,make it really easy to lock your doorsand get everything delivered to you.This is infrastructureand this is consumer behaviorthat is already ingrained,especially in major cities across China.So people just went home.There was also a stigma issue,which is unfortunatefor people from Hubei,and especially from Wuhan.But there are plenty of storiesin the other major Chinese citieswhere anyone coming from Hubeior with any connection to Wuhanwere ostracized during those early days,especially after the Wuhan lockdown.And so folks that might have been,in fact, carrying the virus,because they were from the epicenter,they were either self-quarantined,or they were forcibly quarantined,because no one was goingto spend time with them anyway.So I think for a lot of those reasons,some of them social,some of them systemic,they made it so that there wasmuch less person-to-person contact,especially after the authorities admittedthat human-to-humantransmission was possible.", "CA: Hospitals here in New York,there are warningsthat they're about to get overwhelmed.What can we learnfrom what happened in Wuhan,some of the scenes from therewere horrifying,but there were amazing stories as well.What should we learnfrom what happened there?", "GL: Well, it started off horrifying.So in the early days, post-lockdown,all the stories coming out of Wuhan,we had journalists that were thereright before the lockdown,they got out about three hoursbefore the lockdown happened,and we had people what ended uphaving to be quarantined,because they were stuck in Hubei.As well as a lot of citizen journaliststhat were documenting what was going on,and those images, like you said,Chris, were horrifying.There were videos showing peopleliterally laying on the ground.Some were just so sick they couldn't move,others had already diedand they were just coveredwith plastic sheets.There were nurses and doctorsthat were just cryingin front of the camera, begging for help.And so, I thinkit's important to understandthat China's health care systemdid not just immediately become effective.And certainly not in Wuhan.There was not that much information,people didn't knowwhat they were dealing with.Certainly, the authoritieswere trying to help,I think at that moment,but again, the information flowwas not that free.And during lockdown,people were screamingoff of their balconies,because they couldn't get food,they couldn't even go to the hospital,because the public transportationsystems got locked down.Remember, this is not,Wuhan is not a city like New Yorkwhere most of New York is walkable.For people who don't have cars,and many, many of the Wuhanresidents don't have cars,if the buses are locked down,then they might have to walkthree, four hours, to get to a hospital.Maybe not that long,but they have to walk a long wayto get to a hospital.And so a lot of peoplewere just stuck at home,and they were unable to initiallyget any diagnosis or any health care.And so it was a disaster.But then the capacity actually ramped up.The triage systembecame extremely effective.", "I think most people have heard nowthat there were two massive hospitalswith thousands of beds of capacitythat were built within 10 days.And this is true,they came out of nowhere,they were literallyjust parking lots or flat ground,and two major hospitalunits were built up.To be clear, also,those were the triage unitsfor those who have very mild symptoms.But that's really important.Being able to get peoplewith mild symptomsout of the major hospital systems,so that they're not taking upthe resources of nurses and doctors,they are not taking upthe diagnostic equipmentfor the second confirmation tests,and also, especially,they are not taking up isolation wardsand ventilators.And so the moment people startedbeing moved out, the mild symptoms,the ones that were going to surviveand they just really neededto be separate from familyand have some antiviral medication,once they were moved outinto these new hospitals,the main hospitals in Wuhanand across Hubeicould deal with the primary patients,especially those that are critical,of the overall tested populationand do their best and try and save themand make sure that they're nothighly infectious.At the same time, I thinkthat the health authorities in China,especially the nurses and the doctors,did a very good jobof also protecting themselves.So there have been far fewer,by percentage, infections and deaths,of medical staffthan there were during SARS.", "CA: I mean, to respond that effectivelytook a kind of top-down drive.Plus a willingness of a lot of peopleto risk their own well-beingin a way for their perceptionof what they had to dofor the public good.You are well aware of the culturaldifferences between China, Hong Kongand the West.Do you -- how do you rate the chancesof, say, the US responding effectivelyshould things really explode here,as they seem like they may be about to?", "GL: In the health care system side,I have every confidencethat the US health care systemis going to be able to respond well.I have many, many friendswho are medical professionalsin the United States,and they are raising their handsand volunteeringand going to hospitalsto see where they can help.So I have full trust in the system,and the people that man those systems.Our health care capacityin the United Statesis also significantly greater,doctors per capita,than in China.And because of the factthat also, our health care systemis not just relying on hospitals,but there are primary care physiciansscattered all over the country,as long as the testing capacityand testing kits are availableacross the country,general practitionerscan actually administer those.And it certainly sounds like more and moremed tech start-ups in the USare now trying to create these home kits,so that people can start testing at home.That will help a lot.My hope is certainlythat the citizens of the US,that people are going to take thisvery, very seriouslyand realize that it doesn't matterthat you may not feel sick,it doesn't matterif you think you are youngand that you are not proneto catching this virus,or that you're not in --you may not be fearfulof dire consequences and death.Take it seriously and stay home.And don't go to public spaces,and don't be a carrier,because we now knowthat asymptomatic folks can be carriersand there is a possibilitythat you can be infectiousas an asymptomatic carrier.So yeah, on the cultural side --I don't think it's really cultural.I would say thatit's because of the impact of SARS,it's because of the social memory of SARSthat has meant peopleare a little bit more selfless,and have just said, \"OK, I will stay home,because I might have come in contact.\"", "CA: Yeah, weirdly,SARS seems to have actedas its own kind of vaccine,sort of just prepped the system enoughfor people to be ready.Yeah, social vaccine, amazing.Back to you, Whitney.", "WPR: OK, great, thanks so much, Chris.And so I think it's interesting,Gary, to hear you talkabout some of the reactions in Wuhanand some of the stories that you've heard,especially runningthe \"South China Morning Post\"and running a news organizationduring this outbreak.You know, what are some of the --First, what is that like,to run a news organization,to report during this outbreak?", "GL: Well, running a news organizationin a moment like this,so close to the initial epicenterwhere the outbreak started,is complicated.We were lucky, very, very luckythat most of our senior editors,and certainly the most senior editors,our editor in chief,our masthead leadership,they were all journalistsand they were reporters during SARS.So there's a lot of patternrecognition in our newsroom.Which meant the momentthat we got the first,sort of, the first storiescoming out of China,starting on December 30,people already raising their handsin the newsroom saying,\"Hey, we've got to report about thislike it's going to be the next SARS.There's a high likelihoodthat this is it.\"And we did send people to Wuhanearly on in January.Like I said, we also had reporters thereright before the lockdown.After the lockdown, we were lucky enoughto pull all of them out of Wuhan.But we actually did change very quicklythe way that we report.Partially to make surewe got the story right,to dig deeper in the placesthat we knew we had to dig deeper,but also to protectour journalists and employees.So one of the things that we did do,and maybe other news organizationswould disagree with our decision,was I think in late Januaryor early February,even in Hong Kong,we said to our journalists,\"You are not to go into hospitals.\"So no more in-hospital reporting.Because they were --we knew that it was highly infectious,we were worriedthat they were going to becomeyou know, points of spread,and we just wanted to protectour employees and our company,so we did that.We also had a business continuity plan.Which meant that at the drop of a dimewe could shut down the entire officeand still operatethis global news business.Some of the most interestingstories we've coveredis actually how technologyhas played a huge role in Chinaduring this epidemic.Because it frankly has changedthe way that diagnostics work,it changed the way that containment works,it certainly has changed the waythat consumer life works.And of course,there's been a lot of instancesof really interesting censorship,but also, more interestingly,how the Chinese netizenshave fought that censorshipand reacted to that censorship.And I do think that there'squite a lot of lasting impactsthat are likely to happenbecause of technologydeployment during this time.", "WPR: And so I think in talkingabout some of those lasting impacts,now that you as a countryare sort of emerging from thisand coming on into a different stagewith this outbreak,what are some of the changesyou're seeing to daily life,both as society,and maybe things that you're hearingthat individuals are experiencingas a result of this?", "GL: Yeah, I think probablythe two most interesting changes,actually, I should say three --The first one is on education.Now schools have beenshut down across Chinafor quite some time nowand again, this might feela little bit stereotypical,or a caricature of China,but education is extremelyimportant to the countryand extremely important to the citizens.And we were actually just aboutto come up to the national exams,which these students work 18 years for.And so online education --very, very quickly moved online.And part of that move onlinewas that courses had to be,and classes had to be recorded.Which means that now,there's this huge repositoryof recorded classes.That means potentialdemocratization of education material,and significantly lowered coststo get this type of courseworkfrom the top tiered schools,whether it's high schools,universities or primary schools,to the entire country.Now whether or notChina activates on that,we're still not sure,but the potential is there.", "The second major shiftis really on distributed workforce.The idea of working remotely,office work remotely,is not much of a concept in Chinaand across most of Asia.Certainly far lessthan in the United States.And I'm from the US tech industry,so it was pretty normal,it's pretty normal in the UStech industry even before this,in China much less so.But because of the lockdowns,not only in Hubei but across China,this has become much more normal.And people are kind of fallinginto a different rhythm of work.And most importantly,this has given rise to a whole new setof teleconferencing companies in China.Because most of the teleconferencingcompanies that we know of in the West,whether it's the Cisco systems,Google Hangouts, Zoom,that everyone uses,BlueJeans, Slack video,they're not available in China.They don't work in China.There is this mirror internet in China,behind the Great Firewall,and so there's a whole new setof teleconferencing systemsthat were used,but were not really commonplace,certainly not for distributed workforce,and now suddenly,over the last few months, they are.So it will be interesting to seehow those companiesand those services develop,and whether or notthe workplace changes in China.", "And then finally, the third thingthat is really interestingis that there was a huge internet responseto this censorship issue in Chinaover the course of the last two months.It especially explodedafter this whistle blower, Dr. Li,died on February 7.All over the Chinese internethashtags like \"we want freedom of speech,\"\"national hero Dr. Li,\"things like that just exploded everywhere.And there have been --And actually the Chinese governmenthas had to respond,I think for observers,a lot of observers believethat Chinese government'schange of narrative about Dr. Liwas largely driven by this reactionfrom its citizens across the internet.There have beenextremely creative examplesof people getting around censorship.I think China is quite famousfor using emojisto get around tech censorship.I think most people also knowthat the primary messaging appthat the Chinese internet users use,called WeChat,it is heavily censored,it's not just text that's censored,images are censored really effectively,individual conversations are censored.And so when there are specific articlesor specific posts that areabout what's happening with the virusthat people want to share,and the government thinksthat it is detrimental to whatever,they will censor and it will be completelyand very effectively removed.But this time around,Chinese citizens used emojis again.They translated these postsinto ancient Chinese textsthat the censoring machinescouldn't pick up yet,they actually translatedone version of this postinto Tolkien's Elvish language,I don't even knowthe name of that language,they translated into thatand the AI couldn't pick it up.And then finally,I think one of my favoriteversions of thiswas they used the \"Star Wars\" intro,the angled text scrolling,it became a video,and they had the entire postabout what was going on in Wuhanin that format,and that went all over the internet.So I do think that thereis going to be an increased call.Academics now are speaking upabout freedom of speech.So there's going to bethis increased volume of netizenscalling for freedom of speech.It will be very, very interesting to watchhow the authoritiesin China deal with that.", "WPR: Great. And Chris,you have a question?", "CA: Yeah, it sort of picks up on thatabout, you know, the storiesthat could come out of this.I mean, there are definitelyoptimistic storiesthat people are feeling,that this could lead to morefree speech of a certain kind in China.Certain things you can't suppress.Maybe in the US it might leadto the government takingscientific predictions more seriously,not clear that's happening yet.And there's hope that this whole thing,because it's a common enemy for the world,will actually bring the worldtogether in some ways.But I'm curious how you think about this.President Trump started referring to thisas the Chinese virus.I'm curious how that's beingreceived in China,and how people are feeling on this issue.Do you think it's increasedsympathy for other countriesor actually dialed up animosity?", "GL: Well, it's certainly notbeing received well across China.I think one thing that is stillreally undercoveredis the intensity of rising nationalismat the grassroots level across Chinaover the last several years.And they're very protectiveof their country,and their people and their history.And President Trump's commentsand the fact that so muchof the US governmentis now referring to thisas the Chinese virusis not received well.You know, my fear of course,is that even prior to the virus,the US-China conflict was escalatingbeyond anything that I thinkmost of us as observers want to see.Trade, tech, military, ideology,and now we can add information conflictand health conflict,health tech conflict especially,to the list.Of course, the hope isthat these heightened tensionswill actually dissipateand that the two countries can actually,at this moment in time,choose to go down one of two paths.Either one that furtherdamages the relationshipor one that actually showswhat the possibilities areif the two largest economies in the world,the two most powerfulcountries in the world,actually cooperate.You know, this week,Thursday is the G20 conversationsthat are going to happen remotely.It will be interesting to seehow US and Chinaactually coordinate, cooperate,how they communicate during those talks.", "CA: I think people want to knowhow you think this will play out.You've got a very special seat there,you know, looking at all partsof the world in it.What's your take on how this plays out?", "GL: I desperately wantto be an optimist, Chris.But I think that everything we see,especially the data,shows that it is going to getfar worse before it get better.And I'm very fearful for what's going onin the United States.It's because of the amount of data we haveacross all these different countries,you can very clearly layer countriesand the way that the pandemichas been spreading,on top of one another,and we know that the USis a week and a half,maybe two weeks, behind Italy,and we know what happened in Italyand what's going on in Spain.The US is catching up on that spikeand it's going to come much faster,and it's going to be much higherthan I think most peopleoriginally believed or hoped for.So it will get worse.So the hope is that,again, this is going to bethe optimistic side of me,that the nations will come together,that those in charge, our governments,will make the drastic, necessary moves,and we will be able to come outon the other side fasterthan it looks right now.Remember, when China went to shutdown,on January 23,there were only 830 confirmed cases.And even if those numbersare not exactly accurate,it's nowhere near the confirmed casesthat we have in the US right now,that we see in the US.So that is somethingto be very, very concerned about.At 830 they shut down.And even after the shutdown,two weeks later,the cases had grown to 35,000,two weeks after that, it was at 75,000.So at this point, it is late in the US.But, we, you know --it can still be fixed.And I think most ...experts that we talk tobelieve that it can be fixedwith fast and decisive action.", "CA: Yeah, people strugglewith understanding the powerof exponential growth.And a number can seem smallish today,but if you believe the science,yeah, you have to act.Gary, look, I hope somehowyou will convey to whomever you can conveythat regardless of whatsome people might say,in government or elsewhere,there are millions,there are tens of millions,there are probably hundredsof millions of people in the US,on both right and left,who are amazed by what happened in China.You know, yes,missteps early on, whatever.But they're amazed,you've really --you know, both the Chinese government,the Hong Kong government,several Asian governments,Singapore, South Korea,have shown astonishingly wiseand disciplined actionagainst this thing.And we're grateful,we feel there is muchwe can learn from youand so --People, most people want this to be a timeof bringing the world together.I genuinely believe that,it's maybe the optimisticpart of me believing it.But I believe in it,it's partly what theseconversations are for,to try and makethose kinds of connections.We want to keep in touch.You've got an amazing seat there,and I have loved listeningto every word you've said today here.It's just I've learned so much from you.So thank you for that.", "GL: It was a great conversation.", "WPR: Thank you for your insight.", "CA: And thank youto our whole online audience,I mean, this is a journey,every day we're learning something new.And just in case anyone out thereis feeling a little bit powerless,and afraid or you know, at the situation,I mean, the one thing that everyonecan do right now, I think,is we can reach out to the people we know,we can encourage each of usto be our best selvesin this moment.I really think it's whatthe world is going to need,when people are angry and fearful,we can turn into nasty people.But when we're --When we realizehow much we need each other,and are willing to just reach outand share stories of hopeand share what we're feelingand share possibilities,we can really impact each other,and I see so manyincredible instances of thatfrom around the world,whether it's Italianssinging to each other joyfullyfrom each other's balconies,or these sort of tales of heroismthat some of our health workershave been engaged inall around the world.There's going to need to bea lot more of that.And honestly, every single personcan play a part in how they are online,what they share,how they react.So I don't want to be overly,embarrassingly Kumbaya,but I kind of think we needthat spirit right now a little bit.We need each other,and TED is going to tryand play that role a bit.So if you hate that,maybe you don't need to be here,but I hope you don't hate that.I hope you like thatand will be part of it.Whitney, it's so fun cohosting these,thanks to the rest of the amazing TED teamwho are everyone in our individual homes,they are sort of racing around,trying to make this stuffwork technically.We're learning a bit each day, I hope.Thanks so much for being part of this.", "WPR: Thank you, everyone, thank you.We'll see you all back here tomorrow." ] } }

"Schizophrenia was first identified more than a century ago,but we still don’t know its exact causes.It remains one of the most misunderstood and stigmatized illnesses today.So, let’s walk through what we do know— from symptoms to causes and treatments.", "Schizophrenia is considered a syndrome,which means it may encompass a number of related disordersthat have similar symptoms but varying causes.Every person with schizophrenia has slightly different symptoms,and the first signs can be easy to miss— subtle personality changes, irritability,or a gradual encroachment of unusual thoughts.Patients are usually diagnosed after the onset of psychosis,which typically occurs in the late teens or early twenties for menand the late twenties or early thirties for women.A first psychotic episode can feature delusions, hallucinations,and disordered speech and behavior.These are called positive symptoms,meaning they occur in people with schizophreniabut not in the general population.It’s a common misperception that people with schizophreniahave multiple personalities,but these symptoms indicate a disruption of thought processes,rather than the manifestation of another personality.Schizophrenia also has negative symptoms,these are qualities that are reduced in people with schizophrenia,such as motivation, expression of emotion, or speech.There are cognitive symptoms as well, like difficulty concentrating,remembering information, and making decisions.", "So what causes the onset of psychosis?There likely isn’t one single cause,but a combinationof genetic and environmental risk factors that contribute.Schizophrenia has some of the strongest genetic links of any psychiatric illness.Though about 1% of people have schizophrenia,children or siblings of people with schizophrenia are ten times likelierto develop the disease,and an identical twin of someone with schizophreniahas a 40% chance of being affected.Often, immediate relatives of people with schizophreniaexhibit milder versions of traits associated with the disorder—but not to an extent that requires treatment.Multiple genes almost certainly play a role,but we don’t know how many, or which ones.", "Environmental factors like exposure to certain viruses in early infancymight increase the chance that someone will develop schizophrenia,and use of some drugs, including marijuana,may trigger the onset of psychosisin highly susceptible individuals.These factors don’t affect everyone the same way.For those with very low genetic risk,no amount of exposure to environmental risk factorswill lead them to develop schizophrenia;for those with very high risk, moderate additional risk might tip the balance.", "The antipsychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia have helped researcherswork backwards to trace signatures of the disorder in the brain.Traditional antipsychotics block dopamine receptors.They can be very effective in reducing positive symptoms,which are linked to an excess of dopamine in particular brain pathways.But the same drugs can make negative symptoms worse,and we’ve found that negative symptoms of schizophrenia may be tiedto too little dopamine in other brain areas.Some people with schizophrenia show a loss of neural tissue,and it’s unclear whether this atrophy is a result of the disease itselfor drug-induced suppression of signaling.Fortunately, newer generations of antipsychotics aim to addresssome of these issues by targeting multiple neurotransmitters,like serotonin in addition to dopamine.It’s clear that no one transmitter system is responsible for all symptoms,and because these drugs affect signaling throughout the brain and body,they can have other side effects like weight gain.", "In spite of these complications, antipsychotics can be very effective,especially when combined with other interventionslike cognitive-behavioral therapy.Electroconvulsive therapy, though it provides relatively short-lived relief,is also re-emerging as an effective treatment,especially when other options have failed.Early intervention is also extremely important.After months or years of untreated psychosis,certain psychoses can become embedded in someone’s personality.And yet, the dehumanizing stigma attached to this diagnosiscan prevent people from seeking help.People with schizophrenia are often perceived as dangerous,but are actually much more likely to be the victims of violencethan the perpetrators.And proper treatment may help reduce the likelihood of violenceassociated with schizophrenia.", "That’s why education— for patients, their families, and their communities—helps erode the stigma and improves access to treatment." ] } }

needs,your bills and even some more to spend,the assumption is that you'd be happy,or, even better, fulfilled.And it seems unthinkablewhen you wake up and sayyou're going to leave a job like thatto pursue a passion.And that was my dilemma six years ago.I had a comfortable job,I lived a comfortable life,and people expected me to be fulfilled,but I wasn't.There was somethingin me that wanted more.There was a misalignmentbetween the things I did on a daily basisand the things that I deeply cared about.", "And so I decided to quitand explore the possibility of bringingthis passion into my daily routine.And the thing about finding your passionis that it's not straightforward.Even for people with money and degrees,they still struggleto identify their passion.And here I was as a 30-year-old,talking about finding my passionand turning it into a career.Literally, people told me,\"You don't talk about passionuntil you've made enough money --", "(Laughter)", "or at least untilyou're ready to retire.\"Because there's a notionthat looking inwardand finding the things that give uspleasure and fulfillmentis a luxury that only the rich can enjoy,or a pleasure that onlythe retired can indulge in.Which made me wonder:Is passion only for the rich,or an experienceonly the retired can enjoy?", "For many of us, we've been led to believethat life is a race of survival.We've been conditionedto see ourselves as survivorsthat must do everythingin our power to survive.In Africa, we're nurtured to gothrough school, cram and pass,in the hope that you get a job after.And if you do, stick at itno matter how much it sucks.", "(Laughter)", "Until you get a better offeror you're asked to retire.And as a dropout,I knew that I wasnot entitled to anything.Every opportunity was a privilege.And so when I thought about quitting,it was a huge risk.", "I was given two alternatives,which are the most popular in Africa.The first one is sign up for any courseat a vocational institution and do it.My second option,settle for any job offer you can get,no matter the working conditions,and do it.That probably explains why we haveso many of our young peoplebeing traffickedin search of greener pastures.", "I opted for the first option.I did look at a couplevocational institutionsin the hope that I would find a coursethat resonated with my persona,my dream and my aspiration.I was disappointed to learn that therewas no room for misfits like mein these institutions.The education systemin many parts of the worldhas been designedaround preselected optionsthat young people are expectedto fit in or risk becoming misfits.And so going through school,I was nurtured and conditionedto think in the straight lineand stay within the straight line.", "But when I dropped out,I discovered a world of possibilities.I knew I could be anything,I could study anything,and so I leveraged free online courses.That's how I built my CV,got into employmentand worked for eight years.And after eight years,I told myself there must be more to lifethan just going throughthe routines of life.", "So in 2014, I startedan organization called Kyusawhere we are workingwith out-of-school youthand empowering them to turn their passionsinto profitable, scalableand sustainable businesses.", "Now, when we talk about passion,one of the most common questionsthat people ask is, \"What is passion?How do I even find it?\"And in the simplest definition,passion is a collectionof your life experiencesthat give you the deepestsense of fulfillment.And to identify your passion,you need to look inward.So we use two reflective questions.The first question we ask is,\"If you had all the timeand the money in the world,what would you spend your time doing?\"It sounds like a very simple question,but many people struggleto answer this questionbecause they've justnever thought about it.", "The second question we askis, \"What makes you happyor gives you the deepestsense of fulfillment?\"Now, you would assume that we allknow what makes us happy,but it's also interesting to notethat so many people have no ideawhat makes them happy,because they are so busygoing through the routines of life,they've never stopped to look inward.And so identifying the thingsthat give us a deep sense of fulfillmentand the things that give us deep joyare thoughts that begin to direct usin the direction of our passion.And just in case you're wonderingwhat your answers areto those two questions,I invite you to sit with these questionslater and just reflect about it.", "However, I am also awarethat passion alonecannot guarantee success in life.And I should notethat not every passioncan become a career.For passion to become a career,it must be coupled with the right setof skills, conditioning and positioning.So when we get our young peopleto look inward,we also ask them what skills do you have,what talents do you have,what experience do you havethat you can use to builda niche in the marketplace.But more than that,we also look at the market trends,because it doesn't matterhow much you love and enjoy it.If nobody wants itor is willing to pay for it,it can't be a career.It's just a hobby.", "And the third thing we look atis how do you position yourself?Who are you targeting?Who do you want to sell to?Why would they want to buy from you?And so the combination of the threeis what enables you to movefrom just a passion to a business.And many of our young peoplehave been able to turn their ideasand burning desiresinto profitable businessesor social enterprises,and they're not just creating jobs,but they are solving societal challenges.", "I'll share with you two examples.One of them is Esther.I met Esther two years ago.She had been out of school for two years,and she had been deeply affectedby her dropping out.As a result, she had experiencedsevere depressionto a point where she attemptedto take her own life several times.Her friends and familydidn't know what to do for her.They simply prayed for her.When I met Estherand I started to converse with her,I asked her a simple question.I said, \"If you had all the timeand the money in the world,what would you do?\"Without thinking or hesitation,her eyes lit up and she began to tell mehow she wanted to changethe lives of young people.She wanted to restorehope and dignity to other teenagersby helping them makeinformed decisions about life.", "I was certain of the factthat this burning desire in herwas unquenchable.And so we worked with Estherto put a framework around this desire.Today, she runs a socialenterprise in her village,raising awareness about substance abuse,mental health, sexual reproductive healthand is helping other school dropoutsacquire vocational skills,so they can make a living for themselves.Esther turned 20 this year,and for the last two years,she has organized an annual teen festthat brings together over 500 teenagers.", "(Applause)", "Young people that are ableto network and collaborateon different projects,but more importantly to meet professionalsthey would otherwise never have met.", "This is all engineered by a girl thatbelieved the world had no room for her,that without educationshe would never amount to anything.But by looking inwardand tapping into a burning desire,putting structure around it,it has become a modelthat not only changed her lifebut is transforming the livesof hundreds of young people every year.", "My other example is Musa.Musa is a natural artistic guy.He's the kind that would lookat any design and replicate it with ease.And so he seeks to recognizethat ability in him.When I met Musa,he was doing all kinds of crafts --bags, belts, wallets --but it was more of a part-time thing.Or sometimes, if he was really brokeand needed to make quick money,then he would come upwith a design and sell it.But he had never thoughtof it as a business.", "We started working with Musa,helping him shift his mindsetfrom a hobby to a businessand beginning to rethink how he canmake products that he could selland even be able to scale.Musa makes some ofthe most amazing bags I've ever seen,and over the last one year,Musa's business has grown.He has been recognizedin different places.Currently, he's talking aboutexporting to developed countries.", "Musa, like any other dropout,believed that withoutacademic credentials,he wouldn't amount to anything.He thought the talent he had was nothingsimply because he did not havean academic paper to define him.But by looking inward and findingthat what he had was the greatest assetand supporting himto turn it into a business,he's not just living -- he's thriving.", "The thing about looking inwardis that it can be scary,especially if you're doing itfor the first time.But the truth isyou never truly start livinguntil you learn to livefrom the inside out.And in unlocking potential,we need to look inward to identifythe things that give usa deep sense of fulfillment,the things that give us the deepest joy,and then weave theminto the patterns of our daily routines.In so doing, we cease to workand we start to live.And the thing about living is thatyou never have to retire or to resign.", "(Laughter)", "(Applause)", "And so as you think aboutunlocking potential for ourselves,for our young people, for our children,let's not condition them to look outwardbut condition them to look inwardto tap into who they are and bringthat self into what they do every day.", "When you cease to work and you live,when passion becomes a career,you don't just excel,you become unstoppable.", "Thank you.", "(Applause)" ] } }

tools for us to navigatethrough and thrivein these really uncertain times.I'm Whitney Pennington Rogers,TED's current affairs curator,and I'll be one of your hostsfor today's event.", "Yesterday, we kicked off this serieswith an interview from acclaimedpsychologist Susan David,who offered us some tipson how to really be our best selvesin these trying times.And we're going to switch gearsa little bit todayfrom thinking aboutour own personal mental healthto the state of our globalpublic health systems.", "Chris Anderson: Thank you.I guess we have a prettyexciting guest to introduce.On the other side of the country,let's bring in Bill Gates.Bill, they saythe better-known people are,the less you have to intro them.It's great to have you here.How are you doing?", "Bill Gates: I think this isan unprecedented,really disconcerting time for everyone,with things being shut down,not knowing exactlyhow long it's going to last,worrying about the healthof all the people we care about.You know, I'm luckythat I get to connect upwith video conferencing using Teams a lot,so the Foundation is stepping upand there's a lot of great peopletrying to help with this crisis.But it's scary for everyone.", "CA: Are you basically stuck at homelike many of us watching?", "BG: Yeah, almost all my meetingsare using Teams now,I'm getting used to that.You know, I've gone dayswithout seeing any coworkers.", "CA: Let's start here, Bill.Five years ago, you stood on the TED stageand you gave this chilling warningthat the world was in danger,at some point, of a major pandemic.People watching that talk now,their hair stands upon the back of their neck --it is exactly what we're living through.What happened, did peoplelisten to that warning at all?", "BG: Basically, no.You know, I was hopefulthat with the Zika and Ebolaand SARS and MERS,they all reminded usthat, particularly in a worldwhere people move around so much,you can get huge devastation.And so the talk was to say,hey, we're not readyfor the next pandemic,but in fact, there's advances in sciencethat if we put resources against them,we can be ready.Sadly, very little was done.There were some things --the Coalition for EpidemicPreparedness Innovation, CEPI,was funded by our foundation,Wellcome Trustand a number of governments,to do some of the platform vaccine work,but in the area of diagnostics,antibodies, antivirals,basically doing the disease gamesthat I talked about,where we'd simulatewhat needed to be done.We hardly did anything,and so now here we havea respiratory virusthat is, sadly, fulfilling someof the more negative predictions I made.", "CA: Last month, you saidthat this might be the big one.You wrote that this could bethe sort of once-in-a-century pandemicthat people had been fearing.Is that how you think of it still?", "BG: Well, it's awful to say this,but we could have a respiratory viruswhose case fatality rate was even higher,if this was something like smallpox,you know, that kills 30 percent of people.So this is horrific.But in fact,most people, even who getthe COVID disease,are able to survive.So it's quite infectious,way more infectiousthan MERS or SARS were.It's not as fatal as they were.And yet, the disruption we're seeing,in order to knock it down,is really completely unprecedented.So this is going global,that was --it's respiratory,that was the great fear.How many people end up dying --hopefully, if we do the right things,it won't be a gigantic number.So, you know, we should end upnot having the 1918 flu situation.We should be able to doa lot better than that.", "CA: And that's because of actionsthat we would take.I mean, left without the right actions,the prospects are pretty deadly.If we knew what we knew in 1919,this thing could take outtens of millions of peoplearound the world.You said --is the key thing here that it's gotthis sort of a strange combinationof being certainlymore dangerous than flu --not as dangerous as somethinglike Ebola or SARS,but more dangerous than fluby a factor, but infectious,and also infectiousbefore symptoms have started,is that part of whyit's been really hard to respond to?", "BG: Right.Ebola,you're actually flat on your backbefore you're very infectious.So you're not at churchor in a bus or at a store.With most respiratory viruseslike the flu and COVID,at first you only feel a little bitof a fever and a little bit sick,and so there's the possibilityyou're going about your normal activitiesand infecting other people.And so human-to-humantransmissible respiratory virusesthat in the early stagearen't stopping you from doing things,that's kind of a worst case,and that's where, you know,I did a flu simulation in the 2015 talkand showed how quickly it spread.You know, versus 1918,people move around a lot more nowthan they used to,and so that works against us.Now the medical systemthat steps up to treat peopleis also far, far better.", "CA: But when was it clear to youthat unless we acted,this could be a really deadly pandemic?", "BG: Well, in January it was discussedthat there was human-to-humantransmission taking place.And so the alarm bells were ringingthat this fits the very scary patternthat it will be very difficult to contain.And on January 23,China did their equivalentof the shutdown.Did it in a fairly extreme form.The very good newsis that they were able to reducethe infection rates dramaticallybecause of those actions.But it's January where everybodyshould have been on notice --let's get our act together with testing,let's get going ontherapeutics and vaccines,we've got to get organizedbecause we have this novelrespiratory viruswhose infectiousness and fatalityput it in that superscary range.", "CA: And so, what did happen?Because it's such a mystery to meabout the \"lost month\" of preparationsin many countries and certainly in the US,where we are.Were you on the phone to peopleduring early February,late January, early February,saying, \"Guys, what's going on,this is a really big deal,what are we doing?\"What was happening behind the scenesduring that period?", "BG: Well, you'd like to havegovernment money show upfor the key activities.We put out 100 million,we created the Therapeutics Accelerator,there's the period betweenwhen we realized it was transmittingand now, where we should have done more.I think the most important thingto discuss todayis that in the area of testing,we're still not creating that capacityand applying itto the people most in need.And so we have health workerswho are symptomatic,who can't get a testand so they don't knowshould they go in or not go in,and yet we have lots of testsbeing given to peoplewho aren't symptomatic.So the testing thing to me,it's got to be organized,it's got to be prioritized,that is super, super urgent.The second thing is the isolationthat, you know, various parts,just focusing on the US,some parts are doing thatin a fairly strong wayand other parts not yet,and it's very hard to do,it's tough on people,it's disastrous for the economy.But the sooner you do it in a tough way,the sooner you can undo itand go back to normal.", "CA: So we'll cometo the isolation part in a minute,but just sticking with the testing thing,I'm just so confused as to why,with more than a month's notice --I mean, there are so many smartepidemiologists in the US, for example,you plug numbersabout infectiousness and fatalityinto any simulationand you see that if you don't do anything,millions of people will die.And there's a month.So what's your explanation,what do you think happened hereas to why there was almost no --a month later,there was no viable test in the US.Was this just government complexity,too many chefs in the kitchen,what on earth happened here?", "BG: Well, we certainly didn't takeadvantage of the month of February.The good news is that the actual process,the PCR machines,we have a lot in the United States.And so there's models like South Korea,who took advantage of February,built up the testing capacity,and they were able to contact-traceand their infections have gone down,even without the type of shutdownthat, because we're late,we're having to do.One thing that is good news just this weekis that people had thoughtto do this test,that you had to have a nurse or doctorshove a swab way up,all the way to the back of your throat,which hurts a lot,but also, you're going to coughand potentially spread the diseaseto that health care worker.So they have to have protective equipmentand change that.We sent data to the FDA this weekend,showing that justan individual, by themselves,swabbing up to the tip of their nose,the accuracy of that testis essentially the sameas having a health care worker do it.That helps a lot.We still have to do other things,but that means that youdon't have to change protective equipment,you just hand the patient that swab,they do it, put it in the test tube,and if the capacity is right,within 24 hours,you should get that result back.", "CA: So how do you see that playing out?Are there people going to massivelyscale those testsand how will ordinary citizensbe able to get hold of them?Does it still have to be kind ofprescribed by a doctor at some point,or at some point, will you be ableto order them off Amazon or something?", "BG: Well, it's pretty chaotic today,because the government hasn't stepped into make sure the testing capacityis both increasedand it's used for the right cases.There will be a website --and if the federalgovernment doesn't do it,a lot of local governmentswill have to do it --that you go to, you give your situation,including your symptoms,you're told, based on your workand your symptoms,are you a priority.If so, you're told wherethere are kiosks you can go toand you'll do the self-swaband just hand it over,or eventually, we'll sendthe kits to you at home,and then you'll send it backand hear that result.Maybe six months from now,you'll actually have a stripwhere you perform the test in the home,but for now, they're sending it backfor the PCR processing.We can have massive capacity there.And that's how you know.The testing is everything,because that's how you knowwhether you need to do more shutdownor you're starting to get to the pointwhere you can relieve it.", "CA: Some people are trying to argue nowthat, almost, the testingshould be dialed back,because the cat is out of the bag,testing is bringing people togetherand risking infection,you know, forget that,let's just focus on treatmentand on isolation strategies.You disagree with that.Testing is still absolutely essentialand needs to be scaled dramatically.", "BG: The two that go together are testing,at very high volume,and the isolation piece.If you're a medical worker,you want to stay and do your job.If you're making surethe electricity, water, foodis still available,you want to do your job,and so testing is what indicates to you,do you need to go into isolationand make sure you're notthe source of spread.And so, you know,testing is the key thing.South Korea did that in this massive waythat everybody should learn from.And so that is pairedwith the isolation piece.Our goal here is to get to the pointwhere a very small percentageof the population is infected.You know, China, only 0.01 percentof the population was infected.If you let it,if you don't do these things,you're going to getthe majority of people infectedand that huge overloadof the medical system.", "CA: Whitney has some questionsfrom our online audience. Whitney.", "WPR: Some of the questionsthat we're seeingare about how our tech giants and leaderscan play a role in isolating thisand containing this virus.", "BG: The tech companies are very involvedin making sure that some work can go on.People can stay in touch,you know, they can helpwith some of the disease modeling,they can help withthe visibility of the numbers.It's actually very impressive,you get up thereand you can see those numbers.Actually, they're sad numbers,but everybody's ableto monitor this thing.Back in 1918, they didn't havethis type of visibility,and ability to share best practices.But for a lot of people,the isolation is the key thing.", "CA: Bill, one of the riddlesabout this isolation strategyis how long it has to last.A lot of people are concernedthat the price of victoryby isolating everyoneis that you crash the economy,and that we have to be, basically,at home, not doing our regular jobsfor three, six months, maybe all year.And so much so that there's nowthis big debate in the USand other countriesabout this may just be the wrong strategy,that we can't crashthe economy that badly,we should only isolatefor another couple of weeks,and then let people back,and if that meansa lot of other people get sickand we eventually build up herd immunity,that may be the right way to go.What's your thought on this,what is the isolation strategythat eventually leads to usgetting back to normal?", "BG: It's very tough to say to people,\"Hey, keep going to restaurants,\"you know, \"Go buy new houses,ignore that pile of bodiesover in the corner,just, you know, we want youto keep spending,\"because there's some, maybe a politicianwho thinks GDP growthis what really counts.It's very hard to tell people,when there's an epidemic spreadingthat threatens,particularly, their parentsor elderly people that they know,that they should go about thingsknowing that their activityis spreading this disease.I don't know of any rich countriesthat have chosen to use that approach.It is true, if you did that approach,over a period of several years,enough people would be infectedyou'd have what's called herd immunity.But herd immunity is meaninglessuntil you infect over half the population.And so you can take --You'll overload your medical system,so your case fatality rate,instead of being one percent,will be like three, four percent.And so,the idea, it's very irresponsiblefor somebody to suggestwe can have the best of both worlds.What we need is the extreme shutdownso that in six to ten weeks,if things go well,then you can start opening back up.", "CA: So just putting the math togetherfrom what you just said, Bill,to get to herd immunity,you need more than halfthe people in the countryto basically get the bug.So in the case of the US, for example,that would be 150 millionpeople, thereabouts.You said that the fatality ratein that scenario,you're talking about fourto five million peoplepotential fatalities.That is just a horrifying scenariothat no one should be contemplating.", "BG: Even one percentof the population getting sick,they will treat, whoever goesfor this \"ignore the disease\" strategy,they will treat them as a pariah state,so none of their people will go in,and none of your people will go into that.And so briefly, a few countries in Europethat hadn't really looked at this hard,considered, \"OK, should we be the oneswho kind of go about business as usual?\"It is tempting,because if you got there early --South Korea did not have to dothe extreme shutdown,because they didsuch a good job on testing.", "CA: Testing and containment.", "BG: That's why it's so maddening to methat governmentis not allocating the testingto where it's needed,and maybe that will have to happenat the state level,because it's not happeningat the federal level.But there is no middle courseon this thing.It is sad that the shutdownwill be harder for poorer countriesthan it is for richer countries.", "CA: So let's come into that in minute.The one exception I've heardthe case made for is Japan,that Japan has not contained itquite in the same waythat South Korea didbut has allowed people to work.It's tried to make extreme measuresfor protecting their mostelderly population.But they've tried to finda middle scenario, haven't they?", "BG: If you act --When you have hundreds of cases,you may be able to contain itby doing great testingand great contact tracing,and restricting foreigners coming in,without as much damage to your economy.The US is past this opportunityto control without shutdown.So the worst case of what was happeningin Wuhan in the beginningor in northern Italyover the last few weeks,that we avoid that.But we did not act fast enoughto have an ability to avoid the shutdown.", "CA: But then what I don't understand,in the case of the US, for example,is that even if we're successfulin bending the curve and reducingthe number of new casesfrom a period of extremeshutdown, as it were,no immunity has been built up.Let's say that there's still no vaccine.Surely when you lift restrictionsand people start going back to work,the whole thing just blows up again.", "BG: The experience that we're seeingin China and in South Koreais that there are not these peoplewho are asymptomaticthat are causing lots of infections.And that's a parameterthat, as you build the model,you have to put in.There's an Imperial modelthat people talk about a lot,which shows that reopeningis very hard to do.But the results of that modelare not matching what we see in China,and so very likely,there aren't as manyof these infecting asymptomatics.And that's why you have to be pragmatic.There's a lot we don't know.For example, seasonalitymay help us in the Northern Hemisphere,the force of infection will --Respiratory viruses,to some degree, they all are seasonal.We don't know how seasonal this one is,but you know, there's a reasonable chancethat the force of infectionwill be going down.And it's your testingthat always is telling you,\"Oh, my gosh, do I have to shut down more,or can I start to open up?\"So particularly, right as you open up,that testing and contact tracingis saying to you --And you can say I'm moreon the optimistic side,that it will be possible to dowhat China's doing,where they are startingto go back to normal.", "CA: And help me understandwhat happened therebecause it seems kind of miraculous to me,because this virus was exploding,yes, in Wuhan, but people moved from thereto many other parts of China.How is it possiblethat the combinationof the shutdown in Wuhanand measures elsewhereseem to have got to the pointwhere there are literallyno new cases happening.I mean, to me,that implies that literally,the virus is not circulating at allbetween humans in China.You know, there's a few touristscoming in who they deal with,but I mean, is that literallyyour interpretation of what happened,that it's no longer circulating in China?", "BG: Absolutely.Take a spreadsheetand take a number like four --one person infects four people --and say the cycle is every 10 days.Go through eight of those cycles,and you're getting the big number.You know, start with 10,000 and then,you know, that increase.If you take the number 0.4 instead,that is, the average caseinfects 0.4 people,then look at what happensto that number as you go out.It drops to zero,and so things that are exponentialare very, very dramatic.When they're above one,they are growing rapidly.When they're below one,they are shrinking rapidly.And so the isolation in Chinadrove that reproductive numberto well below zero.And so local infection rates --", "CA: Below one.", "BG: Below one, sorry.And that quarantine,you know, quarantine comes from \"40 days,\"which is what they thoughtwould help for black plague,that is our primary technique.Thank God we have testing,if we use it properly.We are doing therapeutics,which will help with the death rate,but in terms of keeping the infectionsbelow one percent of the population,it really all dependsjust on the two things:isolation and testing.", "CA: So to quote a question frommy Twitter feed this morning for you Bill:If you were presidentfor a month in the US,what would be the toptwo or three things you would do?", "BG: Well, the clear messagethat we have no choiceto maintain this isolationand that's going to keep goingfor a period of time,you know, probably in the Chinese case,it was like six weeks,so we have to prepare ourselves for that,and do it very well.And then use the testingand every week, talk aboutwhat's going on with that.If you're doing isolation well,within about 20 days,you'll see those numbers really change,you know, instead of this,you'll see this,and that is a signthat you're on your way.Now, you have to stayto get more generationsthat are 0.4 infectionsper previous infection.You have to maintain itfor a number of weeks there.And you know,so this is not going to be easy.We need a clear message about that.It is really tragicthat the economic effects of thisare very dramatic.I mean, nothing like thishas ever happened to the economyin our lifetimes.But bringing the economy backand doing money,that's more of a reversible thingthan bringing people back to life.And so, we're going to take the painin the economic dimension,huge pain,in order to minimize the painin the disease and death dimension.", "CA: Whitney.", "WPR: We have a lotof other questions coming in.One that we've been seeingis a question about what toolsare available for countriesthat maybe don't have the luxuryof being able to social-distance,don't have great health systems in place,how should they be handling this virus?", "BG: Yeah, I would say,if the rich countriesreally do their job well,by the summer, they'll be like China is,or some of the other countriesthat responded early.But in the developing countries,particularly in the Southern Hemisphere,the seasonality is large.As you say, the ability to isolate,you know, when you go outto get your food every day,you have to earn your wage,when you live in a slumor you're very nearby each other,it's very hard to do,as you move down the income ladder,than it is for a countrylike the United States.And so we should allaccelerate the vaccine,which eventually will come,and you know, peopleare being responsible to saythat that's going to take 18 months.And there's a lot of those being pursued.I'm talking a lot with Seth Berkley,who you're going to have later this week,who can talk a lotabout the vaccine front,because he's definitelyat the center of that,being the head of GAVI.We do need to get really cheap testingout to these countries,and we need to get therapeuticsso you don't need to putfive percent of people on respirators.Because even if they had the equipment,they don't have the personnel,they just don't havethe beds, the capacity.And so the only good newsis that the rich countries have thisand so they will be learningabout testing, therapeutics,and funding the vaccinesfor the entire world,to try and minimize the damagein developing countries.", "WPR: Great, I'll be back laterwith more questions.", "CA: Bill, you mentionedtherapeutics there.What is looking promising,is anything looking promising?", "BG: Yeah, so there's quitea range of things going on.There's a few that get mentioned a lot,remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine,azithromycin,and the data is still a bit confusing,but there's some positive data on those.Remdesivir is a five-day IV infusion,and actually kind of hard to manufacture,so people are lookingat how that can be improved.The hydroxychloroquine looks likeit works, somewhat,if you get in early.There's a huge list of compounds,including antibodies,antiviral drugs,and so the Gates Foundationand Wellcome Trust,with support from Mastercardand now others,created this therapeutics acceleratorto really triage out.You have hundreds of people showing upand saying, try this, try that.So we look at lab assays, animal models,and so we understand which thingsshould be prioritizedfor these very quick human trialsthat need to be done all over the world.So the coordination on thatis very complex, globally.But I think, you know,out of the top 20 or so candidates,probably three or four of themwill work out,you know, at differentstages of the disease,to reduce the respiratory distress.", "CA: I heard you mentionedthat one possibilitymight be treatmentsfrom the serum, the blood serum,of people who had hadthe disease and recovered.So I guess they're carrying antibodies.Talk a bit about that, how that could workand what it would take to accelerate that.", "BG: Yeah, this has always been discussedas how could you pull that off.So people who are recovered,it appears,have really effectiveantibodies in their blood.So you could go,transfuse them and only take outthe white cells, the immune cells.And then the question is,OK, how many patients' worthof material could you get?You know, if you havethat recovered person come in,say, once a week,do you get enoughfor two people or five people?Then logistically, you have to take thatand get it to where that need is.And so it's fairly complicated,you know, compared to a drugthat we can make in high volume.You know, the cost of taking it outand putting it back inprobably doesn't scale as well.But there is work being done on this.You know, we actually started with Ebola,and fortunately, it got donebefore it was needed.So that is being pursuedand it will work to some degree,but it will be hard to scale the numbers.", "CA: So it's almost like,when you talk about the needto accelerate testing,the immediate needis for testing for the virus.But is it possiblethat in a few months' time,there's going to be this growing needto test for these antibodies in people,i.e. to see if someonehad the disease and recovered,maybe they didn't even know they had it.Because you could picturethis growing worldwide force of heroes --let's call them heroes --who have been through this experienceand have a lot to offer the world.Maybe they can offerblood donation, serum donation.But also other tasks,like, if you've got overwhelmedhealth care systems,presumably, there are kind ofcommunity health worker type tasksthat people could be trained to doto relieve the pressure there,if we knew that they wereeffectively immune?", "BG: Yes.Until we came up with the self-swaband showed FDA that that's equivalent,we were thinking that peoplewho might be able to man those kioskswould be the recovered patients.Now we don't want to havea lot of recovered people, you know.To be clear, we're trying,through the shutdown,in the United States,to not get to one percentof the population infected.We're well below that today,but with exponentiation,you could get past that three million.I believe we will be able to avoid thatwith having this economic pain.Eventually, what we'll have to haveis certificates of whois a recovered person,who is a vaccinated person,because you don't want peoplemoving around the world --where you'll have some countriesthat won't have it under control, sadly --you don't want to completely block offthe ability for those people to go thereand come back and move around.", "CA: Bill, is your foundation helpingto accelerate the manufactureof these self tests?What are the prospectsfor really seeing scaleon some of this testing soon,not just in the US, but globally?", "BG: Yeah, our foundation,we'd been funding the thingcalled the Flu Studyto really understandhow respiratory viruses spread.It's amazing how little was understoodabout how important schools are,different age groups,different types of interaction.And that gave us an experience.In fact, that flu studyactually was the first timecoronavirus was found in the community,because the government was still sayingyou only test peoplewho'd come from China,but we ran into peoplewho had coronavirus,who hadn't been travelers.So, that was like an early warning sign,even though the regulation saidyou weren't supposed to even look at that.So yeah, the Foundation is workingwith all the private sector people,the diagnostics peopleon this testing piece.Now that we can do the self-swab,those swabs are very easy to manufacture.The one where you hadto jam it into the throat,deep turbinate,that was getting into short supply.So the swab should not be limiting,neither should the various chemicalsthat help run the PCR machines.So we should be ableto get to a South Korea-typeprioritized testing thingwithin a few weeks.", "CA: How important is itthat the world's nationscollaborate right now?I mean, it seems like, you know,here's this common enemy facing humanity,it does not knowthat it just crossed a border,it does not know what race people are,what religion they are --it just knows, \"Here's a human,I've got a manufacturing machine herethat can make me famous.\"And it goes to work.It's so terrifying to me to seesigns of countries startingto blame each otheror the xenophobia, it just seems so toxic.What's your take on this, Bill?Do you see signs of cooperation happening,or are you also worried about the sort of,\"US versus China\" kind of thingthat seems to be going onif we're not careful?", "BG: Well, I see both.I see that countries that are recoveredcan help other countries.And that's fantastic.If by the summer,we've knocked this thing down,then great, we can help other countries.There are vaccine projectsall over the world,and those should be evaluatedon a very neutral basis,to which one is the best to help humanity.And make sure the manufacturing capacityisn't just for rich countries,that it's scaled up, very low cost stufffor the entire world,and that's the spirit of GAVI,is getting vaccines out to every person.So in the science side,and data-sharing side,you see this great cooperation going on.Unfortunately, whenever you have disease,this sense of other and foreignand \"Oh, stay away from me,\"you know, that sort ofpulling inward is reinforced.And we have to avoid that.You know, ironically,we have to isolate physically,while in terms of lookingat community groupsthat are pooling resourcesto help make sure food gets to everyoneand help assure medical care,you know, if older people needto be moved out of common facilities,you help out with that,and that people aren't suffering too muchfrom the psychology of isolation.So our generosityhas to go up towards othersat the same time we're less actuallyphysically interacting with other people.", "CA: I mean, thinking about the situationin many developing countries,I'm curious how you think of this.You mentioned, first of all,that seasonality may help,i.e. high temperatures.Is it possible that that is so farprotecting, to some extent,places like Indiaor sub-Saharan Africa and so forth?", "BG: India's Northern Hemisphere.So Southern Hemisphereis lots of Africa, South America,Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia.And it is true,either the forceof the infection is lower thereor we're just not seeing it with testing.You know, a few months from now,we'll understand the seasonality question,which would be good newsfor the Northern Hemisphere,and somewhat bad newsfor the Southern Hemisphere.Now more people livein the Northern Hemisphere,including India, Pakistan,and that would buy us some time,and time is a big deal,because all these tools get so much betterif you had to go intoa second season with it.But yeah, sadly,we could see, in the next few months,as the Southern Hemisphereis moving into its fall and then winter,we could see a big increase there,and that is going to be very difficult.Now they don't have as many older people,but they have lots of peoplewho are HIV positive,or have malnutritionor various lung challengesbecause of indoor smoke,and so the wild cardis how well can the developingcountries deal with this.", "CA: If you're in a countrywhere the majority of your populationis making less than twoor three dollars a day,can you even afford a strategythat looks like, basically,shutting down the economy?", "BG: I'm very worried that there will bea massive number of deathsin those poorer countries,because the health systems just aren't --you know, the numberof respirators, hospitals,and of course,when you overload that system,your deaths are not just COVID deaths,but everyone else who's trying to accessa system that will be somewhat in chaos,including with health workerswho are getting sick.", "CA: OK, we're getting nearto running out of time with this.Whitney, maybe a last questionor two from online.", "WPR: Sure, we have two from online,we're seeing thousands of questionsaround these same lines.One, there's lots of peoplewho are really interested to hearabout the kind of work that you're doingwith your foundationas far as distributing tests,but also producing safety gear,masks and that sort of thing,to help with this effortfor health workers.", "BG: So the Gates Foundation,you know, we, very early on,gave out 100 millionto help out with all the pieces:the testing piece,the therapeutics and the vaccines.We are not experts in making masksand ventilators and gowns,and it's great that other people,including some 3D printing,and open-source things, that is great.Our focus, you know,like this self-swab thing,nobody had done that before,people thought it wouldn't work,we were quite sure it would work.And so that, for the globe,is a huge thing.We work a lot with bothgovernments and private sector,so in some ways, we're kind of a bridge.And we've been talking to the headsof the pharmaceutical companies,the testing companiesand, specifically,with the ones doing vaccines,including some of which are these newtype of vaccines, RNA vaccines,that we've been backingfor quite some time,and CEPI has been backing.And so our expertiseis in those medical toolsand really getting the bestof the private sector engaged there.It's been a little slow.We can write checks right away,whereas the government processes,even in this situation --you know, there's stillthis notion of bidding,and not really knowing who hasthe unique capabilities of doing things,and so, an organizationthat's working on this all the time,lots of new vaccines,can step in and be helpful.And it's really amazing.When we talk to private-sector partners,their interest in helping outhas been absolutely fantastic.And so that's where we have a unique role.", "WPR: And the other questionthat we're seeing a ton of --before we wrap up here --is just people are really interestedin your insight, Bill,on whether you think we are headingin the right direction,do you feel like our economyis heading in the right place,that humanity is headingin the right place,are we in a better position nowthan you thought we were infive years ago?", "BG: Well, five years ago,I said that pandemicis this unaddressed,very, very scary thing.And that if we did the right things,we could be more prepared.Science is on our side.The fact we can be readyfor the next epidemic,it's very clear how to do that.And yes, it will take tens of billions,but not hundreds or trillions of dollars.So it will be tiny comparedto the economic cost.I remember when I didthat presentation 2015,I put up, \"Hey, a big flu epidemiccould cost four trillion,\"and I thought, wow, that's a big number,do I really think it's that big?And I went and looked up numbersand thought, yeah, well, that's big.This epidemic will costthat much to the economy.So in the short run,we are going to have more painand more difficultyand people are going to have to step upto help each other.I'm still very much an optimist, you know,whether it's climate change,countries working together,biology taking the diseases, malaria, TB,you know, even advancesfor what are more rich-world diseases,like cancer.The amount of innovation,the way we can connect upand work together --yes, I'm superpositive about that.You know, I love my workbecause I see progresson all these diseases all the time.Now we have to turnand focus on this, you know.Sadly, it may interruptand the polio situationmight get worse a little bitbecause of the distraction here.We're using a lot of the great capacitythat was built upfor those polio activitiesto try and help the developing countriesrespond to this very well.And that is appropriate,but the message from me,although it's very soberwhen we're dealing with this epidemic,you know, I'm very positivethat this should draw us together.We will get out of this,and then, we will get readyfor the next epidemic.", "CA: That's exactlywhat I was going to ask you, Bill,which is, where is your head,do you think we will get through this?Will the leaders that matterlisten to the scientists,will they?Will we make it through?Do you believe that withina few months' time,we're already going to belooking back and saying,\"Phew, we dodged a pretty bad one there.\"", "BG: We can't say for surethat even the rich countrieswill be out of thisin six to ten weeks.I think that's likely,but as we get the testing data,we'll get more of a sense of thatand people will continuouslybe able to see that.But you know, the rich countrieswill get out of this.The developing countrieswill bear a significant price,but even they, we will get a vaccineand GAVI will get that out to everyone.So you know, two to three years from now,this thing, even on a global basis,will essentially be overwith a gigantic price tag.But now we're going to know,OK, next time we see a pathogen,we can make billions of testswithin two or three weeks.We can figure outwhich antiviral drugs workwithin two or three weeksand get those scaled up.And we can make a vaccine,if we're really ready,probably in six months,using these new platforms,probably the RNA vaccine.So specifically, there are innovationsthat are therethat will get financed,you know, I hope, quite generously,coming out of this thing.And so, three years from now,we'll look back and say,you know, that was awful,there's a lot of heroes,but we've learned a lessonand the world as a whole,with its great scienceand desire to help each other,was able to try and minimizewhat happened thereand avoid it happening again.", "CA: That's certainlythe optimistic scenariothat I'm craving for, myself.That the world kind of realizes,one, that there are certain thingsthat you just have to unite on.Two, that science really mattersand it's a miracle that sciencecan understand this bug,you know, make a vaccine,sequence it, make therapeutics,understand how to model it --it's kind of miraculous to me.So will we learn, now,to pay attention to scientists,because if we do,I'm sure that you feel this as well,there's an amazing analogue with climate,it's just a different timescale.That the scientists are out there, saying,\"There's this huge enemy coming,if we do nothing,it's going to take millions of lives,it's going to wreck our planet.For God's sake, act, politicians!Do something.\"And the politicians are going, \"Meh, no.We need a little more GDP,we need to win an election.\"And they're not acting.Do you see a scenariowhere this shocks politiciansto actually change their thinkingand their prioritizationof science overall,or is that asking too much?", "BG: Yeah, it's interestinghow much of this distractionwill delay the urgent innovation agendathat exists over in climate.You know, I have freed upa lot of time to work on climate.I have to say,you know, for the last few months,that's now shifted,and until we get out of this crisis,COVID will dominate,and so some of the climate stuff,although it will still go on,it won't get that same focus.As we get past this,yes, that idea of innovation and scienceand the world working together,that is totally commonbetween these two problems.And so I don't think this has to bea huge setback for climate.", "CA: Last question.There are thousands of people watching,many of them living alone,some quite scared,there may even be people therewho have this virusand are suffering symptoms or recovering.By the way, if that's you,we'd love to hear from you,we really would.Maybe have a conversationwith some of you,in a future one of these,just understanding the experience.But Bill, what can people doas individuals from their own homes,right now, to try and help?", "BG: Well, there's a lotof creativity, you know --can you mentor kids who are being forcedinto an online formatwhere the school systemsreally weren't ready for that?Can you organize some giving activitythat gets the food banks to step upwhere there's problems there?These are such unprecedented times,and it really should draw outthat sense of creativity,while complyingwith the isolation mandates.", "CA: Bill, I really want to thank youfor spending this time with usand for the financial investment,the time investment.You've really invested your lifeinto trying to solve these big problems.And this is as big as they get.I have a hunch that your voiceis really going to be neededin the next few weeks.Thank you so much for your time today.This was really wonderful,hearing from you.Thank you.", "BG: Thanks, Chris.", "CA: OK, thanks, everyone,thanks for being partof the TED community.Look after yourselves,be smart about this.You know, get ahead of it.If you're in a part of the worldwhere this thing hasn't really hit,listen to Bill Gates.Get ahead of it.Keep, you know, if you possibly can,socially distanced.No, not -- physically distancedand socially connect.That's what the internet is for.These days are whatthe internet was built for.We can spread love, we can spread ideas,we can spread relationship,we can spread thought,without spreading a dangerous bug.So get ahead of it,and let's figure this out together.It's been wonderfulspending time with you.From Whitney and from meand from the whole TED team,thank you, and over and out." ] } }

there's an oncoming caror perhaps there's a childabout to run into the street.Fortunately, our future carwill have this superpower,a camera that can see around cornersto detect these potential hazards.", "For the past few years as a PhD studentin the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab,I've been working on a camerathat can do just this --a camera that can image objectshidden around cornersor blocked from direct line of sight.", "So let me give you an exampleof what our camera can see.This is an outdoor experiment we conductedwhere our camera system is scanningthe side of this building with a laser,and the scene that we want to captureis hidden around the cornerbehind this curtain.So our camera systemcan't actually see it directly.And yet, somehow,our camera can still capturethe 3D geometry of this scene.", "So how do we do this?The magic happens herein this camera system.You can think of thisas a type of high-speed camera.Not one that operatesat 1,000 frames per second,or even a million frames per second,but a trillion frames per second.So fast that it can actually capturethe movement of light itself.And to give you an exampleof just how fast light travels,let's compare it to the speedof a fast-running comic book superherowho can move at up to three timesthe speed of sound.It takes a pulse of lightabout 3.3 billionths of a second,or 3.3 nanoseconds,to travel the distance of a meter.Well, in that same time,our superhero has movedless than the width of a human hair.That's pretty fast.But actually, we need to image much fasterif we want to capture lightmoving at subcentimeter scales.So our camera system can capture photonsat time frames of just50 trillionths of a second,or 50 picoseconds.", "So we take this ultra-high-speed cameraand we pair it with a laserthat sends out short pulses of light.Each pulse travels to this visible walland some light scattersback to our camera,but we also use the wallto scatter light around the cornerto the hidden object and back.We repeat this measurement many timesto capture the arrival timesof many photonsfrom different locations on the wall.And after we capturethese measurements, we can createa trillion-frame-per-secondvideo of the wall.", "While this wall may lookordinary to our own eyes,at a trillion frames per second,we can see something truly incredible.We can actually see waves of lightscattered back from the hidden sceneand splashing against the wall.And each of these wavescarries informationabout the hidden object that sent it.So we can take these measurementsand pass them intoa reconstruction algorithmto then recover the 3D geometryof this hidden scene.", "Now I want to show you one more exampleof an indoor scene that we captured,this time with a varietyof different hidden objects.And these objectshave different appearances,so they reflect light differently.For example, this glossy dragon statuereflects light differentlythan the mirror disco ballor the white discus thrower statue.And we can actually see the differencesin the reflected lightby visualizing it as this 3D volume,where we've just taken the video framesand stacked them together.And time here is representedas the depth dimension of this cube.", "These bright dots that you seeare reflections of lightfrom each of the mirroredfacets of the disco ball,scattering against the wall over time.The bright streaks of light that you seearriving soonest in timeare from the glossy dragon statuethat's closest to the wall,and the other streaks of light come fromreflections of light from the bookcaseand from the statue.", "Now, we can also visualizethese measurements frame by frame,as a video,to directly see the scattered light.And again, here we see, first,reflections of light from the dragon,closest to the wall,followed by bright dotsfrom the disco balland other reflections from the bookcase.And finally, we see the reflectedwaves of light from the statue.These waves of light illuminating the wallare like fireworks that lastfor just trillionths of a second.And even though these objectsreflect light differently,we can still reconstruct their shapes.And this is what you can seefrom around the corner.", "Now, I want to show you one more examplethat's slightly different.In this video, you see medressed in this reflective suitand our camera system is scanning the wallat a rate of four times every second.The suit is reflective,so we can actually capture enough photonsthat we can see where I amand what I'm doing,without the cameraactually directly imaging me.By capturing photons that scatterfrom the wall to my tracksuit,back to the wall and back to the camera,we can capture this indirectvideo in real time.", "And we think that this typeof practical non-line-of-sight imagingcould be useful for applicationsincluding for self-driving cars,but also for biomedical imaging,where we need to seeinto the tiny structures of the body.And perhaps we could also putsimilar camera systems on the robotsthat we send to explore other planets.", "Now you may have heardabout seeing around corners before,but what I showed you todaywould have been impossiblejust two years ago.For example, we can now image large,room-sized hidden scenes outdoorsand at real-time rates,and we've made significant advancementstowards making this a practical technologythat you could actually seeon a car someday.", "But of course, there's stillchallenges remaining.For example, can we imagehidden scenes at long distanceswhere we're collectingvery, very few photons,with lasers that are low-powerand that are eye-safe.Or can we create images from photonsthat have scattered around many more timesthan just a single bouncearound the corner?Can we take our prototype systemthat's, well, currently large and bulky,and miniaturize it into somethingthat could be usefulfor biomedical imagingor perhaps a sort of improvedhome-security system,or can we take this new imaging modalityand use it for other applications?I think it's an exciting new technologyand there could be other thingsthat we haven't thought of yetto use it for.", "And so, well, a futurewith self-driving carsmay seem

ask myselfhow a future brilliant citywould ensure that nobody is homelessand nobody slips through the cracks.", "And here's wherefuture history comes in handy,because cities don't just spring

have layersof past architecture,repurposed buildingsand all of the signs of howwe got to this place.", "And then there's second-order effects,like how do things go wrong -- or right --in a way that nobody ever anticipated?Like, if the walls of your apartmentare made out of a kind of fungusthat can regrow itselfto repair any damage,what if people start eating the walls?", "(Laughter)", "Speaking of eating:What kind of sewer systemdoes the city of the future have?It's a trick question.There are no sewers.There's something incredibly bizarreabout the current system we havein the United States,where your wastegets flushed into a tunnelto be mixed with rainwaterand often dumped into the ocean.Not to mention toilet paper.A bunch of techies, led by Bill Gates,are trying to reinventthe toilet right now,and it's possible thatthe toilet of the futurecould appear incredibly strangeto someone living today.So how does the history of the future,all of that trial and error,lead to a better wayto go to the bathroom?There are companies right nowwho are experimentingwith a kind of cleaning wandthat can substitute for toilet paper,using compressed airor sanitizing sprays to clean you off.But what if those things lookedmore like flowers than technology?What if your toiletcould analyze your wasteand let you know if your microbiomemight need a little tune-up?What if today's experimentswith turning human waste into fuelleads to a smart batterythat could help power your home?", "But back to the city of the future.How do people navigate the space?If there's no streets, how do peopleeven make sense of the geography?I like to think of a placewhere there are spacesthat are partially only in virtual realitythat maybe you needspecial hardware to even discover.Like for one story, I came up with a thingcalled \"the cloudscape interface,\"which I described as a chrome spiderthat plugs into your headusing temporal nodes.No, that's not a picture of it,but it's a fun picture

kind of apocalyptic poop barbecue.", "(Laughter)", "But the truth is, it's not goingto be either of those things.It's going to be in the middle. It's goingto be both.

theseopportunities for exposureand then you can follow up those people,maybe quarantine them, to make surethat no further transmission happens.So it's a very focused, targeted method,and for SARS, it worked remarkably well.But I think for this infection,because some cases are going to be missed,or undetected,you've really got to be capturinga large chunk of people at risk.If a few slip through the

to bea very short step awayfrom someone who is going to get hitvery hard by this.And I think we really needto be socially mindedand think this could be quite dramaticin terms of change of behavior,but it needs to beto reduce the impactthat we're potentially facing.", "[Question 4: How far apartshould people stay from each other?]", "I think it's hard to pin down exactly,but I think one thing to bear in mindis that there's not so much evidencethat this is a kind of aerosoland it goes really far --it's reasonably short distances.I don't think it's the casethat you're sitting a few metersaway from someoneand the virus is somehowgoing to get across.It's in closer interactions,and it's why we're seeingso many transmission eventsoccur in things like mealsand really tight-knit groups.Because

"【问题2：如果光控制疫情还不够的话，我们下一步应该做什么？】", "那样的话，我们的社交方式需要进行巨大改变。那包括，减少所有可能导致病毒传播的机会，像是近距离接触，平均而言，每个人就得减少大约三分之二这种近接触的机会才能有效控制疫情传播。可以通过在家办公，改变生活方式，不去拥挤的场所与餐厅来实现。当然了，像是关闭学校和其他的措施，只能做到尽量避免人群密集接触。", "【问题3：我们需要考虑到哪些可能被传染的风险？】", "重要的不只是你和哪些人握了手，还有那些人会和哪些人握手。我认为我们应该考虑下这些第二阶段的步骤，你也许会觉得你被感染的风险很低，你比较年轻，但你通常会离那些一旦得病就将面临致命风险的人很近。正因如此，我认为我们应具有社会意识，这将导致我们的行为模式产生重大变化，但为了减少我们可能面临的负面影响，这些是必须要做到的。", "【问题4：我们该和他人保持多远的距离？】", "要想说出一个具体数字是很困难的，但我认为大家应记住，目前并没有足够证据表明这种包含病毒的气溶胶能传播很远的距离——它理应只能在很短的距离内传播。我并不认为你坐在离另一人几米远的地方病毒还能穿过这么远的距离。我们应该注意的是近距离接触，这是那么多传染案例发生于就餐场所和人员密集的团体中的原因。因为可以想像，在那些地方病毒更容易到达我们手和脸的表面，我们更应关注这些情况。", "【问题5：世界各国应落实哪些预防措施？】", "我认为大家应首先考虑那些被证实有效的措施。我们也是直到前几周才意识到这种病毒在某种程度的国家干预下是可控的，但当然，并不是所有国家都能做到中国所做的那些，有些措施会对全国人民施加巨大的社会，经济，和心理上的负担。当然了，还要考虑到时间限制。中国仅花了 6 周就控制住了病毒的传播，要做到这点是很难的，所以我们应进行权衡，想想我们能让人民做些什么，哪些措施能最大程度地减少施加于人民身上的负担。", "【欲知更多，请访问：疾病控制和预防咨询中心网站】", "【世界卫生组织网站】" ] } }

we’ve stopped discovering new ones.Still, there’s hope that we can get ahead of the problem.", "But first, how did we get into this situation?The first widely used antibiotic was penicillin,discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming.In his 1945 Nobel Prize acceptance speech,Fleming warned that bacterial resistance had the potential to ruinthe miracle of antibiotics.He was right: in the 1940s and 50s,resistant bacteria already began to appear.", "From then until the 1980s,pharmaceutical companies countered the problem of resistanceby discovering many new antibiotics.At first this was a highly successful— and highly profitable— enterprise.", "Over time, a couple things changed.Newly discovered antibiotics were often only effectivefor a narrow spectrum of infections,whereas the first ones had been broadly applicable.This isn’t a problem in itself,but it does mean that fewer doses of these drugs could be sold—making them less profitable.In the early days, antibiotics were heavily overprescribed,including for viral infections they had no effect on.Scrutiny around prescriptions increased, which is good, but also lowered sales.At the same time, companies began to develop more drugsthat are taken over a patient’s lifetime,like blood pressure and cholesterol medications,and later anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications.Because they are taken indefinitely, these drugs more profitable.", "By the mid-1980s, no new chemical classes of antibiotics were discovered.But bacteria continued to acquire resistance and pass it alongby sharing genetic information between individual bacteriaand even across species.Now bacteria that are resistant to many antibiotics are common,and increasingly some strains are resistant to all our current drugs.", "So, what can we do about this?We need to control the use of existing antibiotics, create new ones,combat resistance to new and existing drugs,and find new ways to fight bacterial infections.The largest consumer of antibiotics is agriculture,which uses antibiotics not only to treat infectionsbut to promote the growth of food animals.Using large volumes of antibioticsincreases the bacteria’s exposure to the antibioticsand therefore their opportunity to develop resistance.Many bacteria that are common in animals, like salmonella, can also infect humans,and drug-resistant versions can pass to us through the food chainand spread through international trade and travel networks.", "In terms of finding new antibiotics,nature offers the most promising new compounds.Organisms like other microbes and fungi have evolved over millions of yearsto live in competitive environments—meaning they often contain antibiotic compoundsto give them a survival advantage over certain bacteria.", "We can also package antibiotics with molecules that inhibit resistance.One way bacteria develop resistance is through proteins of their ownthat degrade the drug.By packaging the antibiotic with moleculesthat block the degraders,the antibiotic can do its job.", "Phages, viruses that attack bacteria but don’t affect humans,are one promising new avenue to combat bacterial infections.Developing vaccines for common infections,meanwhile,can help prevent disease in the first place.", "The biggest challenge to all these approaches is funding,which is woefully inadequate across the globe.Antibiotics are so unprofitable that many large pharmaceutical companieshave stopped trying to develop them.Meanwhile, smaller companies that successfully bring new antibioticsto market often still go bankrupt, like the American start up Achaogen.New therapeutic techniques like phages and vaccinesface the same fundamental problem as traditional antibiotics:if they’re working well, they’re used just once,which makes it difficult to make money.And to successfully counteract resistance in the long term,we’ll need to use new antibiotics sparingly—lowering the profits for their creators even further.", "One possible solution is to shift profits away from the volume of antibiotics sold.For example, the United Kingdom is testing a modelwhere healthcare providers purchase antibiotic subscriptions.While governments are looking for ways to incentivize antibiotic development,these programs are still in the early stages.Countries around the world will need to do much more—but with enough investment in antibiotic developmentand controlled use of our current drugs,we can still get ahead of resistance." ] } }

social issue,menstruation has several facets to itthat overlap, reinforceand worsen the situation.So we based our campaignon four fundamental pillars:health, hygiene, awarenessand spreading positivity.But how did we actually implement this?Well, we started within the wallsof our school classroom.Instead of simply explainingmenstruation to childrenfrom a textbook or biological standpoint,we adopted an innovative approach.We conducted an activity where studentsstrung together a braceletconsisting of 28 beads signifyingthe length of the menstrual cycle,out of which four to seven beadswere of a different color,demonstrating the days a woman bleeds.And in this way, we not onlyexplained what periods arein a manner that was educationalbut also approachable and engaging.To

In this delightful and fascinating talk, biophysicist Jim Hudspeth demonstrates the wonderfully simple yet astonishingly powerful mechanics of hair cells, the microscopic powerhouses that make hearing possible -- and explains how, when it's really quiet, your ears will begin to beam out a spectrum of sounds unique to you.", "tags" : [ "science", "biology", "neuroscience", "physics", "Senses", "human body", "hearing" ], "title" : "The beautiful, mysterious science of how you hear", "video_views" : 119912, "related_talks" : [ "59159", "57604", "17994", "24246", "2610", "24351" ], "transcript" : { "en" : [ "Can you hear me OK?", "Audience: Yes.", "Jim Hudspeth: OK. Well, if you can,it's really amazing,because my voice is changingthe air pressure where you sitby just a few billionthsof the atmospheric level,yet we take it for grantedthat your ears can capturethat infinitesimal signaland use it to signal to the brainthe full range of auditory experiences:the human voice, music, the natural world.How does your ear do that?And the answer to that is:through the cells that are the real heroof this presentation --the ear's sensory receptors,which are called \"hair cells.\"", "Now, these hair cellsare unfortunately named,because they have nothing at allto do with the kind of hairof which I have less and less.These cells were originally named thatby early microscopists,who noticed that emanatingfrom one end of the cellwas a little cluster of bristles.With modern electron microscopy,we can see much betterthe nature of the special featurethat gives the hair cell its name.That's the hair bundle.It's this cluster of 20 to severalhundred fine cylindrical rodsthat stand uprightat the top end of the cell.And this apparatus is what is responsiblefor your hearing me right this instant.", "Now, I must say that I amsomewhat in love with these cells.I've spent 45 years in their company --", "(Laughter)", "and part of the reasonis that they're really beautiful.There's an aesthetic component to it.Here, for example, are the cellswith which an ordinary chickenconducts its hearing.These are the cellsthat a bat uses for its sonar.We use these large hair cells from a frogfor many of our experiments.Hair cells are found all the way downto the most primitive of fishes,and those of reptiles often havethis really beautiful,almost crystalline, order.", "But above and beyond its beauty,the hair bundle is an antenna.It's a machine for convertingsound vibrations into electrical responsesthat the brain can then interpret.At the top of each hair bundle,as you can see in this image,there's a fine filamentconnecting each of the little hairs,the stereocilia.It's here marked witha little red triangle.And this filament has at its basea couple of ion channels,which are proteins that span the membrane.", "And here's how it works.This rat trap represents an ion channel.It has a pore that passespotassium ions and calcium ions.It has a little molecular gatethat can be open, or it can be closed.And its status is set by this elastic bandwhich represents that protein filament.Now, imagine that this armrepresents one stereociliumand this arm representsthe adjacent, shorter onewith the elastic band between them.When sound energy impingesupon the hair bundle,it pushes it in the directiontowards its taller edge.The sliding of the stereociliaputs tension in the linkuntil the channels openand ions rush into the cell.When the hair bundle is pushedin the opposite direction,the channels close.And, most importantly,a back-and-forth motionof the hair bundle,as ensues during the applicationof acoustic waves,alternately opens and closes the channel,and each opening admits millionsand millions of ions into the cell.Those ions constitutean electrical currentthat excites the cell.The excitation is passed to a nerve fiber,and then propagates into the brain.Notice that the intensity of the soundis represented bythe magnitude of this response.A louder sound pushesthe hair bundle farther,opens the channel longer,lets more ions inand gives rise to a bigger response.", "Now, this mode of operationhas the advantage of great speed.Some of our senses, such as vision,use chemical reactions that take time.And as a consequence of that,if I show you a series of picturesat intervals of 20 or 30 per second,you get the sense of a continuous image.Because it doesn't use reactions,the hair cell is fully 1,000 timesfaster than our other senses.We can hear sounds at frequenciesas great as 20,000 cycles per second,and some animals have ever faster ears.The ears of bats and whales, for example,can respond to their sonar pulsesat 150,000 cycles a second.", "But this speed doesn't entirely explainwhy the ear performs so well.And it turns out that our hearingbenefits from an amplifier,something called the \"active process.\"The active process enhances our hearingand makes possible all the remarkablefeatures that I've already mentioned.", "Let me tell you how it works.First of all, the active processamplifies sound,so you can hear, at threshold,sounds that move the hair bundleby a distance of only aboutthree-tenths of a nanometer.That's the diameter of one water molecule.It's really astonishing.The system can also operateover an enormously wide dynamic range.Why do we need this amplification?The amplification,in ancient times, was usefulbecause it was valuable for us to hearthe tiger before the tiger could hear us.And these days, it's essentialas a distant early warning system.It's valuable to be ableto hear fire alarmsor contemporary dangerous such as speedingfire engines or police cars or the like.When the amplification fails,our hearing's sensitivity plummets,and an individual may then needan electronic hearing aidto supplant the damaged biological one.", "This active process also enhancesour frequency selectivity.Even an untrained individualcan distinguish two tonesthat differ by onlytwo-tenths of a percent,which is one-thirtieth of the differencebetween two piano notes,and a trained musician can do even better.This fine discrimination is usefulin our ability to distinguishdifferent voicesand to understand the nuances of speech.And, again, if the activeprocess deteriorates,it becomes harder to carry outverbal communication.", "Finally, the active process is valuablein setting the very broad rangeof sound intensitiesthat our ears can tolerate,from the very faintest soundthat you can hear, such as a dropped pen,to the loudest sound that you can stand --say, a jackhammer or a jet plane.The amplitude of soundsspans a range of one millionfold,which is more than is encompassedby any other senseor by any man-made deviceof which I'm aware.And again, if this system deteriorates,an affected individualmay have a hard timehearing the very faintest soundsor tolerating the very loudest ones.", "Now, to understandhow the hair cell does its thing,one has to situate it withinits environment within the ear.We learn in schoolthat the organ of hearingis the coiled, snail-shaped cochlea.It's an organ aboutthe size of a chickpea.It's embedded in the boneon either side of the skull.We also learn that an optical prismcan separate white lightinto its constituent frequencies,which we see as distinct colors.In an analogous way,the cochlea acts as sort ofan acoustic prismthat splits apart complex soundsinto their component frequencies.So when a piano is sounded,different notes blendtogether into a chord.", "The cochlea undoes that process.It separates them and representseach at a different position.In this picture, you can seewhere three notes --middle C and the twoextreme notes on a piano --are represented in the cochlea.The lowest frequencies go all the way upto the top of the cochlea.The highest frequencies,down to 20,000 Hz,go all the way to the bottomof the cochlea,and every other frequencyis represented somewhere in between.And, as this diagram shows,successive musical tones are representeda few tens of hair cells apartalong the cochlear surface.", "Now, this separation of frequenciesis really key in our abilityto identify different sounds,because very musical instrument,every voice,emits a distinct constellation of tones.The cochlea separates those frequencies,and the 16,000 hair cellsthen report to the brainhow much of each frequency is present.The brain can then compareall the nerve signalsand decide what particulartone is being heard.", "But this doesn't explain everythingthat I want to explain.Where's the magic?I told you already about the great thingsthat the hair cell can do.How does it carry out the active processand do all the remarkable featuresthat I mentioned at the outset?The answer is instability.We used to think that the hair bundlewas a passive object,it just sat there, exceptwhen it was stimulated.But in fact, it's an active machine.It's constantly using internal energyto do mechanical workand enhance our hearing.So even at rest,in the absence of any input,an active hair bundleis constantly trembling.It's constantly twitching back and forth.But when even a weak soundis applied to it,it latches on to that soundand begins to move very neatlyin a one-to-one way with it,and by so doing, it amplifies the signalabout a thousand times.", "This same instability also enhancesour frequency selectivity,for a given hair celltends to oscillate bestat the frequency at whichit normally trembleswhen it's not being stimulated.So, this apparatus not onlygives us our remarkably acute hearing,but also gives usthe very sharp tuning.", "I want to offer you a short demonstrationof something related to this.I'll ask the people whoare running the sound systemto turn up its sensitivityat one specific frequency.So just as a hair cell is tunedto one frequency,the amplifier will now enhancea particular frequency in my voice.Notice how specific tones emergemore clearly from the background.This is exactly what hair cells do.Each hair cell amplifies and reportsone specific frequencyand ignores all the others.And the whole set of hair cells,as a group, can then report to the brainexactly what frequenciesare present in a given sound,and the brain can determinewhat melody is being heardor what speech is being intended.", "Now, an amplifier such asthe public address systemcan also cause problems.If the amplification is turned up too far,it goes unstable and begins to howlor emit sounds.And one wonders why the active processdoesn't do the same thing.Why don't our ears beam out sounds?And the answer is that they do.In a suitably quiet environment,70 percent of normal peoplewill have one or more soundscoming out of their ears.", "(Laughter)", "I'll give you an example of this.You will hear two emissionsat high frequenciescoming from a normal human ear.You may also be able to discernbackground noise,like the microphone's hiss,the gurgling of a stomach,the heartbeat, the rustling of clothes.", "(Hums, microphone hiss, dampened taps, clothes rustling)", "This is typical.Most ears emit just a handful of tones,but some can emit as many as 30.Every ear is unique, so my right earis different from my left,my ear is different from your ear,but unless an ear is damaged,it continues to emitthe same spectrum of frequenciesover a period of years or even decades.", "So what's going on?It turns out that the earcan control its own sensitivity,its own amplification.So if you're in a very loud environment,like a sporting eventor a musical concert,you don't need any amplification,and the system is turned down all the way.If you are in a room like this auditorium,you might have a little bitof amplification,but of course the public address systemdoes most of the work for you.And finally, if you go intoa really quiet roomwhere you can hear a pin drop,the system is turned upalmost all the way.But if you go into an ultraquiet roomsuch as a sound chamber,the system turns itself up to 11,it goes unstableand it begins to emit sound.And these emissions constitutea really strong

three issuesthat I would really liketo address in the future.", "The first is: What is the molecular motorthat's responsible forthe hair cell's amplification?Somehow, nature has stumbledacross a systemthat can oscillate or amplifyat 20,000 cycles per second,or even more.That's much faster than any otherbiological oscillation,and we would like to understandwhere it comes from.", "The second issue is how the hair cell'samplification is adjustedto deal with the acoustic circumstances.Who turns the knob to increaseor decrease the amplificationin a quiet or in a loud environment?", "And the third issue is onethat concerns all of us,which is what we can doabout the deterioration of our hearing.Thirty million Americans,and more than 400 millionpeople worldwide,have significant problems on a daily basiswith understanding speechin a noisy environmentor over the telephone.Many have even worse deficits.Moreover, these deficitstend to get worse with time,because when human hair cells die,they're not replaced by cell division.But we know that nonmammalian animalscan replace their cells,and those creatures' cells are dyingand being replaced throughout life,so the animals maintain normal hearing.Here's an examplefrom a little zebra fish.The cell at the topwill undergo a divisionto produce two new hair cells.They dance for a little bit,and then settle down and go to work.", "So we believe that if we can decodethe molecular signals that are usedby these other animalsto regenerate their hair cells,we'll be able to dothe same thing for humans.And our group and many other groupsare now engaged in researchtrying to resurrectthese amazing hair cells.", "Thank you for your attention.", "(Applause)" ] } }

in my classroomwas pretty much like all of those timesI had an uninvited run-in with the N-word.I froze.Because the N-word is hard to talk about.Part of the reason the N-wordis so hard to talk about,it's usually only discussed in one way,as a figure of speech,we hear this all the time, right?It's just a word.The burning question that cyclesthrough social mediais who can and cannot say it.Black intellectual Ta-Nehisi Coatesdoes a groundbreaking jobof defending the African Americanuse of the word.On the other hand, Wendy Kaminer,a white freedom of speech advocate,argues that if we don't alljust come and say it,we give the word power.And a lot of people feel that way.The Pew Center recentlyentered the debate.In a survey called \"Race in America 2019,\"researchers asked US adultsif they thought is was OKfor a white person to say the N-word.Seventy percent of alladults surveyed said \"never.\"", "And these debates are important.But they really obscure something else.They keep us from getting underneathto the real conversation.Which is that the N-wordis not just a word.It's not neatly containedin a racist past,a relic of slavery.Fundamentally, the N-wordis an idea disguised as a word:that black people are intellectually,biologicallyand immutably inferior to white people.And -- and I thinkthis is the most important part --that that inferiority meansthat the injustice we sufferand inequality we endureis essentially our own fault.So, yes, it is ...", "Speaking of the word only as racist spewor as an obscenity in hip hop musicmakes it sounds as if it's a diseaselocated in the American vocal cordsthat can be snipped right out.It's not, and it can't.And I learned thisfrom talking to my students.", "So next time class met,I apologized,and I made an announcement.I would have a new policy.Students would see the wordin my PowerPoints,in film, in essays they read,but we would never eversay the word out loud in class.Nobody ever said it again.But they didn't learn much either.Afterwards, what bothered me mostwas that I didn't even explain to studentswhy, of all the vile, problematic wordsin American English,why this particular wordhad its own buffer,the surrogate phrase \"the N-word.\"", "Most of my students,many of them bornin the late 1990s and afterwards,didn't even knowthat the phrase \"the N-word\"is a relatively new inventionin American English.When I was growing up, it didn't exist.But in the late 1980s,black college students,writers, intellectuals,more and more started to talk aboutracist attacks against them.But increasingly,when they told these stories,they stopped using the word.Instead, they reduced it to the initial Nand called it \"the N-word.\"They felt that every timethe word was utteredit opened up old wounds,so they refused to say it.They knew their listeners would hearthe actual word in their heads.That wasn't the point.The point was they didn't wantto put the word in their own mouthsor into the air.By doing this,they made an entire nationstart to second-guess themselvesabout saying it.This was such a radical movethat people are still mad about it.Critics accuse those of uswho use the phrase \"the N-word,\"or people who become outraged,you know, just because the word is said,of being overprincipled,politically corrector, as I just read a couple of weeks agoin The New York Times,\"insufferably woke.\"Right?", "So I bought into this a little bit too,which is why the next timeI taught the courseI proposed a freedom of speech debate.The N-word in academic spaces,for or against?I was certain students would be eagerto debate who gets to say itand who doesn't.But they weren't.Instead ...my students started confessing.A white student from New Jerseytalked about standing byas a black kid at her schoolgot bullied by this word.She did nothing and years laterstill carried the guilt.Another from Connecticuttalked about the pain of severinga very close relationshipwith a family member,because that family memberrefused to stop saying the word.", "One of the most memorable storiescame from a very quiet black studentfrom South Carolina.She didn't understand all the fuss.She said everyoneat her school said the word.She wasn't talking about kidscalling each other names in the hall.She explained that at her schoolwhen teachers and administratorsbecame frustratedwith an African American student,they called that studentthe actual N-word.She said it didn't bother her at all.But then a couple of days later,she came to visit mein my office hours and wept.She thought she was immune.She realized that she wasn't.", "Over the last 10 years,I have literally heard hundredsof these storiesfrom all kinds of people from all ages.People in their 50s remembering storiesfrom the second gradeand when they were six,either calling people the wordor being called the word,but carrying that all these yearsaround this word, you know.And as I listened to peopletalk about their points of encounter,the pattern that emerged for meas a teacher that I found most upsettingis the single most fraught sitefor these points of encounteris the classroom.", "Most US kids are going to meetthe N-word in class.One of the most assigned booksin US high schoolsis Mark Twain’s \"The Adventuresof Huckleberry Finn\"in which the word appears over 200 times.And this isn't an indictmentof \"Huck Finn.\"The word is in lotsof US literature and history.It's all over AfricanAmerican literature.Yet I hear from studentsthat when the word is said during a lessonwithout discussion and context,it poisons the entireclassroom environment.The trust between studentand teacher is broken.Even so, many teachers,often with the very best of intentions,still say the N-word in class.They want to show and emphasizethe horrors of US racism,so they rely on it for shock value.Invoking it brings into stark reliefthe ugliness of our nation's past.But they forgetthe ideas are alive and wellin our cultural fabric.", "The six-letter word is like a capsuleof accumulated hurt.Every time it is said, every time,it releases into the atmospherethe hateful notionthat black people are less.My black students tell methat when the word is quotedor spoken in class,they feel like a giant spotlightis shining on them.One of my students told methat his classmateswere like bobbleheads,turning to gauge his reaction.A white student told methat in the eighth grade,when they were learning\"To Kill a Mockingbird\"and reading it out loud in class,the student was stressed outat the idea of having to read the word,which the teacher insistedall students do,that the student ended upspending most of the unithiding out in the bathroom.", "This is serious.Students across the countrytalk about switching majorsand dropping classesbecause of poor teachingaround the N-word.The issue of facultycarelessly speaking the wordhas reached such a fevered pitch,it's led to protests at Princeton, Emory,The New School,Smith College, where I teach,and Williams College,where just recently students haveboycotted the entire English Departmentover it and other issues.And these were just the casesthat make the news.This is a crisis.And while student reactionlooks like an attack on freedom of speech,I promise this is an issue of teaching.", "My students are not afraidof materials that have the N-word in it.They want to learn about James Baldwinand William Faulknerand about the civil rights movement.In fact, their stories showthat this word is a central featureof their lives as young peoplein the United States.It's in the music they love.And in the popular culture they emulate,the comedy they watch,it's in TV and moviesand memorialized in museums.They hear it in locker rooms,on Instagram,in the hallways at school,in the chat roomsof the video games they play.It is all over the world they navigate.But they don't know how to think about itor even really what the word means.", "I didn't even really understandwhat the word meantuntil I did some research.I was astonished to learnthat black people first incorporatedthe N-word into the vocabularyas political protest,not in the 1970s or 1980sbut as far back as the 1770s.And I wish I had more time to talkabout the long, subversive historyof the black use of the N-word.But I will say this:Many times, my studentswill come up to me and say,\"I understand the virulent rootsof this word, it's slavery.\"They are only partially right.This word, which existedbefore it became a slur,but it becomes a slur at a verydistinct moment in US history,and that's as large numbersof black people begin to become free,starting in the North in the 1820s.In other words,this word is fundamentallyan assault on black freedom,black mobility,and black aspiration.", "Even now,nothing so swiftly unleashesan N-word tiradeas a black person asserting their rightsor going where they please or prospering.Think of the attackson Colin Kaepernick when he kneeled.Or Barack Obama when he became president.My students want to know this history.But when they ask questions,they're shushed and shamed.By shying away from talkingabout the N-word,we have turned this wordinto the ultimate taboo,crafting it into something so tantalizing,that for all US kids,no matter their racial background,part of their coming of ageis figuring outhow to negotiate this word.We treat conversations about itlike sex before sex education.We're squeamish, we silence them.So they learn about itfrom misinformed friends and in whispers.", "I wish I could go backto the classroom that dayand push through my fearto talk about the factthat something actually happened.Not just to me or to my black students.But to all of us.You know, I thinkwe're all connected by our inabilityto talk about this word.But what if we exploredour points of encounterand did start to talk about it?", "Today, I try to createthe conditions in my classroomto have open and honestconversations about it.One of those conditions --not saying the word.We're able to talk about itbecause it doesn't comeinto the classroom.Another important conditionis I don't makemy black students responsiblefor teaching their classmates about this.That is my job.So I come prepared.I hold the conversation with a tight rein,and I'm armed withknowledge of the history.I always ask students the same question:Why is talking about the N-word hard?Their answers are amazing.They're amazing.More than anything though,I have become deeply acquaintedwith my own points of encounter,my personal history around this word.Because when the N-word comes to school,or really anywhere,it brings with it allof the complicated history of US racism.The nation's historyand my own,right here, right now.There's no avoiding it.", "(Applause)" ] } }

night and day.Well, in much the same way,there are people now raising awarenessof the issue of noise pollutionand trying to createpockets of quiet in the ocean,so that marine life can enjoya more natural soundscape.", "This is important.Noise isn't just an irritation.It can cause chronic stress,or even physical injury.It can affect marine life's abilityto find food and matesand to listen out for predators and more.Think of all the soundswe inject into the ocean.Perhaps one of the most dramaticis the seismic surveysused to look for oil and gas.Air guns produce loud blasts,sometimes every 10 to 15 seconds,for months on end.And they use the reflectionsof these soundsto map the ground beneath.It can sound like this.", "(Explosion sounds)", "Then, there's the soundof the actual drilling for oil and gas,the construction of thingslike offshore wind farms,sonarand of course, the nearly constant dronefrom more than 50,000 shipsin the global merchant fleet.", "Now the natural ocean itselfisn't exactly quiet.If you put your head under the water,you can hear cracking ice, wind, rain,singing whales, grunting fish,even snapping shrimp.Altogether, that can create a soundscapeof maybe 50 to 100 decibels,depending on where and when you are.", "But mankind's addition to thathas been dramatic.It's estimated that shipping has addedthree decibels of noise to the oceanevery 10 years in recent decades.That might not sound like a lot,but decibels are on a logarithmic scale,like the Richter scale for earthquakes.So a small number can actuallyrepresent a large change.Three decibels means a doublingof noise intensity in the ocean.A doubling.", "And that's only an estimate,because no one is actually keeping trackof how noisy the ocean isall around the world.There is a body calledthe International Quiet Ocean Experiment,and one of their missionsis to try and plug the hole in that data.So for example, last year,they managed to convincethe Global Ocean Observation Systemto start including noiseas one of their essentialvariables for monitoring,alongside thingslike temperature and salinity.", "We do know some things.We know that sonar can be as loud,or nearly as loud,as an underwater volcano.A supertanker can be as loudas the call of a blue whale.The noises we add to the oceancome in all different frequenciesand can travel great distances.Seismic surveys off the East Coastof the United Statescan be heard in the middleof the Atlantic.In the 1960s, they did an experimentwhere they set off a loud noiseoff the coast of Perth, Australia,and they detected itas far away as Bermuda,20,000 kilometers away.", "So what does all thissound like to marine life,what do they hear?It's kind of difficult to describe.Sound travels further, faster in waterthan it does in air,and it also packs a different punch.So sound of the same pressurewill have a different intensitywhether you measure itin the air or underwater.Then there's the fact that whalesdon't have ears exactly like human ears.Creatures like zooplanktondon't even have what you wouldconsider to be ears.So what does this mean,what is the impacton all this marine life?", "Perhaps the easiest thingfor scientists to assessis the effect of acute noise,really loud sudden blaststhat might cause physical injuryor hearing loss.Beaked whales, for example,can go into panicked diveswhen exposed to loud noises,which may even give thema condition similar to the bends.In the 1960s, after the introductionof more powerful sonar technologies,the number of incidents of masswhale strandings of beaked whaleswent up dramatically.And it's not just marine mammals,fish, if they stray too closeto the source of a loud sound,their fish bladders may actually explode.The airgun blasts from seismic surveyscan mow down a swath of zooplankton,the tiny creatures near the baseof the food chain,or can deform scallop larvaewhile they're developing.", "Well, what about chronic noise,the more pervasive issueof raising background noisefrom things like shipping?That can mask or drown outthe natural soundscape.Some whales have responded to thisby literally changing their tune,a little bit like peopleshouting to be heard in a noisy nightclub.And some fish will spend more timepatrolling their bordersand less time caring for their young,as if they're on high alert.", "Chronic noise can affectpeople too, of course.Studies have shownthat people living near busy airportsor really busy highwaysmay have elevated levelsof cardiovascular disease.And students livingunder busy flight pathsmay do worse on some educational tests.And even while I wasresearching this subject,they were actually blasting outabout three meters of solid granitefrom the lot across from my home officeto make room for a new house,and the constant jitteringof the rock hammerwas driving me completely insane.And whenever the workersstopped for a moment,I could feel my shoulders relax.", "This effect has been seen in whales, too.After the terrorist attacks of 9/11,international shipping largelyground to a halt for a little whilein the waters off the East Coastof the United States.And in that lull,researchers noticed that endangeredright whales in that regionhad fewer chemical markers of stressin their feces samples.As one researcher I spoke to likes to say,\"We were stressed,but the whales weren't.\"", "Now you have to remember,we have evolved to be a visual species.We really rely on our eyes.But marine life relies on soundthe way that we rely on sight.For them, a noisy oceanmay be as befuddling and even dangerousas a dense fog is for us.And maybe sometimes that just meansbeing a little more stressed,maybe sometimes it meansspending a little less time with the kids.Maybe some species can adapt.But some researchers worrythat for endangered speciesalready on the brink,noise may be enoughto push them over the edge.", "So take, for example,the southern resident killer whalesthat live in the watersoff my hometown of Vancouver.There are only 75, maybe 76, animals leftin this population.And they're facing a lot of challenges.There are chemical pollutantsin these waters,and they are running low on the salmonthat they really rely on for food.And then there's noise.When researchers studied theseand similar killer whales,they found that they spendbetween 18 and 25 percent less timefeeding in the presenceof loud boat noise.And that's a lot for a speciesthat's already strugglingto find enough food to thrive.", "The good news, as I heardfrom all the researchers I spoke to,is that you can do somethingrelatively easily about ocean noise.Unlike the wicked problemsof climate changeand ocean acidification,you can just dial downthe knob on ocean noiseand see almost immediate impacts.So for example, in 2017,the Vancouver Fraser Port Authoritystarted asking ships to simply slow downwhen going through the Haro Strait,where the southern resident killer whalesare feeding in late summer.Slower ships are quieter ships.And because it's Canada, you can just ask,it can be voluntary.", "(Laughter)", "(Applause)", "In that 2017 trial,most of the ships complied,adding about half an hourto their travel time,and reducing noise by about 1.2 decibelsor 24 percent of noise intensity.This year, they decidedto extend the length of timeand the area over whichthey're asking ships to slow down.So hopefully that hasa positive impact for these whales.", "In 2017, the VancouverFraser Port Authorityalso introduced discounts in docking feesfor ships that are physicallydesigned to be quieter.You know, weirdly, a lot of the noisefrom a ship like thiscomes from the popping of tiny bubblesoff the back of its propeller.And you can simply design a shipto do less of thatand to be quieter.The International Maritime Organizationhas published a huge list of waysthat boats can be made quieter.And they also have a targetof reducing carbon dioxide emissionsfrom global shippingby 50 percent by 2050.And the great news is thatthese two things go hand in hand.On the whole, a moreefficient ship is a quieter ship.", "People have also invented quieter waysof hammering in the giant postsneeded for giantwind turbines, like this one,and gentler ways of doing seismic surveys.And there are some incentivesfor using quieter technologies.The European Union, for example,has a healthy marine systemdirective for 2020.And one of the ways that they definea healthy marine systemis by how much noiseis going in those waters.But on the whole, most watersremain completely unregulatedwhen it comes to ocean noise.", "But again, most ofthe scientists I spoke tosaid that there's real momentumright now in policy circlesto pay attention to this issueand maybe do something about this issue.We already know enough to saythat quieter seas are healthier seas.But now scientists are really scramblingto come up with the details.Just how quiet do we need to be?And where are the best placesto make quiet or preserve quiet?And how best can we hush our noise?", "And you know, I'm not trying to tell youthat noise is the biggestenvironmental problem on the planetor even in the ocean.But the point is that humankindhas a lot of impactson our environmental system.And these impacts don't act in isolation.They act together, and they multiply.So even for the onesthat are not so obvious,we really need to pay attention to them.", "I'll tell you about one last experiment,just because it's so beautiful.So Rob Williams,one of the researchers who workson southern resident killer whales,also does some work in Bali.And there, they celebratea Hindu traditioncalled nyepi, or a day of silence.And this day, apparently,is very strictly observed.No planes take off from the airport,no boats go out fishing,the tourists are gently led off the beachback into their hotel rooms.And Rob Williams put somehydrophones in the water thereto see what the impact was,and it was dramatic.Sound

learnedthat we can use datato help navigate throughthose emotional decisionsand feel confident we're makingthe best decision for our family.Specifically there are three main factorsyou should consider before you decide.", "First, you need to think abouthow this decision will affectyour family budget.Let's do some numbers.Say your total householdincome is 100,000 dollars,with you and your partnermaking 50,000 each.That means you bring homeabout 85,000 dollars after taxes.If both of you workand the family pays1,500 dollars a month for childcare,your total disposable incomewould be 67,000 dollars a year.", "Are you with me so far?If you decide to stay home,your family makes lessbut you don't pay for childcare.Your disposable incomegoes down in this scenario,but not by as much as it wouldif you didn't factor in the childcare.It becomes more complicated if childcareis more expensive in your area.A full-time nannycan run 40, 50,000 dollars a yeardepending on where you live.If that's the case in your neighborhood,in the scenario I outlined,it would completely wipe outone parent's income,and you'd be better off financiallywith one parent staying home.Of course, this is onlya short-term analysis.Childcare is less expensive sometimeswhen kids are in school,and you may make a higher income later,so you wanna factor that in if you can.", "Once you've done the math,you'll know what's possibleand you'll be able to makea more informed choice,which should feel empowering.", "Second, it's time to talkabout what's best for your child.You may think this should bethe core of your decision,but there's actually no right answer.According to studiesfrom Europe and the US,the decision to go back to workor stay at homewon't actually make or breakyour child's future success.Research shows that two parentsworking full-timehas a similar effect on your child'sfuture test scores and incometo one parent working and one not.What seems to be mostimportant is the environmentyour child is in during their spare time.As long as they're engagingin enriching activities;reading, practicing their motor skills,interacting with other kids,they're gonna thrivewhether or not you're at home with them.", "There is a bit of nuance in the data.For example, studies have found,that if both parents work,kids from poor familiesare impacted positively,and kids from richer familiesare impacted less positively.So depending on yourhousehold configuration,the effects on your childcould be a little positive,or a little negative,but the overall impact is negligible.", "Now I wanna call out an exception:maternity leave.There is a growing body of evidencesuggesting that babies do betterwhen their motherstake some maternity leave.The early days with your childcan impact their development,so if you have paid leave,you should take it,and if you don't, maybe considertaking some unpaid leavefor those first few months,if your budget allows.", "And finally, ask yourself, what do I want?While this may seem simple,it's the factor that feelsmost taboo to explore.In talking to parents I find thatwhen a woman chooses to stay home,she often feels obligated to sayshe made this choicefor her children's optimal development.Which, sure, can be part of the reason,but a perfectly acceptable answer is,\"this is the lifestyle I prefer,\"or \"this is what works for my family.\"The same goes for the working mother.Saying, \"I like my job, and that's whyI went back to work,\" is enough.If you wanna go backto work, that's great.You're lucky to have a job that you loveand you have every right to keep itonce you become a parent.", "Be honest with yourselfabout what you'd like to do.If you're upfront about that,you're guaranteed to feel happier,which will allow you to bethe best version of a parent you can be,and isn't that the whole point?There is no right and wrongwhen it comes to parenting.The best decision is the onethat will make you --and your family -- the happiest.Up to you to decide what's next.By acknowledging that the choiceto stay home or notis just that, a choice,with factors pushing youin various directions,we can ditch the guilt and enjoydoing what feels best for our families." ] } }

"【所以我们该如何解决这个问题？】", "解决这种情况并没有什么快方法。我也知道，这很糟糕。没有人能比我更喜欢一个好的工作框架或一个好的缩略词了。但是事实是每个人都有自己的工作节奏。需要每个人自己去发现。直到我开始挖掘我自己关于工作的信仰，我才发现我自己工作方式的根源，并最终舍弃了那些有害的行为方式，转而做出一些积极长期的改变。", "而唯一能达到这种状态的方法就是问自己一些比较残酷的问题。忙碌能让你感觉很有自我价值吗？谁是你心中成功的榜样？你都是从哪儿学到那些工作道德的？你的身份认同在多大程度上与你做的工作相关？", "你的创造力有它自己的节奏。我们的能量在每天、每周，甚至每个季节都会上下波动。我知道自己在一周的开头，通常精力更加充沛，而非一周的末尾。所以我相应的就把大部分工作都移到一周的开头。我很自豪的说我是一个夜猫子，所以我把下午和晚上的时间都留给创造性的工作。我也知道自己通常在舒适的冬季比夏天能写出更多的文章。",

"开始之前，我们先确立一些基本原则，来指导你做出正确决定的流程。其一，想想什么对你来说真正重要，并依此设定选择标准。", "其二，收集相关事实。确保你对所有选择都了如指掌，这样你就能确信你的决定的确是基于事实的。", "其三，记住 FOBO会在你面对若干个完全可行的选择而你只能选择其中一个时才会出现。所以不论你选哪个，你都可以放心，因为每个选项的不利因素是有限的。", "现在一些基本原则已被确立，你可以开始选择了。首先凭直觉选出一个最佳选项，然后将其他选项与该最佳选项进行逐一的、一对一比较。每次比较均须根据选择标准，从两个选项中选出一个并淘汰另外一个。这里有一个避开 FOBO 的秘诀：不要让已被淘汰的选项再次出现。如果你不停地“复活”淘汰选项，你将陷入纠结之中。重复刚才的步骤，直到你得出最终选择。", "如果你遵循这一流程，你通常能得出自己的结论、作出自己的选择。除非你遇到的情况相当罕见，如果是这样，你就得把最终决定权交由一群可靠的、你信任的人，这些人还需要有能力就此话题向你提供意见。人数不要超过 5 位，最好是奇数位，因为一旦出现平票状况，就会有人一锤定音。", "现在你已经做出了选择，但还剩下一个挑战——就是执行这一选择。我不能保证你的选择一定是完美的但我可以告诉你这世界上将有一大部分人可以告别 FOBO 的烦扰。还有成万上亿的人可能没有什么选择，因为他们被战争、贫穷，或疾病所困扰。但与他们不同的是，你有很多机会来做出抉择，虽然并非你的所有愿望都能得以满足。但决定权本身已能让你十分强大。", "其实，决定权是一份馈赠。请充分使用！" ] } }

areasand blocking corridors.And I'm telling you, these elephantsdon't think much of it either,particularly if they're blockinga really special water holewhere they need water,or if there's a very attractivefemale on the other side.It doesn't take longto knock down one of these poles.And as soon as there's a gap in the fence,they go back, talk to their matesand suddenly they're all through,and now you have 12 elephantson the community side of the fence.And now you're really in trouble.People keep trying to come upwith new designs for electric fences.Well, these elephantsdon't think much of those either.", "(Laughter)", "So rather than having these hard-line,straight, electric,really divisive migratory-blocking fences,there must be other waysto look at this challenge.I'm much more interested in holisticand natural methodsto keep elephants and peopleapart where necessary.Simply talking to people,talking to rural pastoralistsin northern Kenyawho have so much knowledge about the bush,we discovered this story that they hadthat elephants would not feed on treesthat had wild beehives in them.Now this was an interesting story.As the elephantswere foraging on the tree,they would break branchesand perhaps break open a wild beehive.And those bees would fly outof their natural nestsand sting the elephants.", "Now if the elephants got stung,perhaps they would rememberthat this tree was dangerousand they wouldn't come backto that same site.It seems impossible that they could bestung through their thick skin --elephant skin is aroundtwo centimeters thick.But it seems that they sting themaround the watery areas,around the eyes, behind the ears,in the mouth, up the trunk.You can imagine they wouldremember that very quickly.And it's not really one stingthat they're scared of.African bees have a phenomenal ability:when they sting in one site,they release a pheromonethat triggers the rest of the beesto come and sting the same site.So it's not one beestingthat they're scared of --it's perhaps thousands of beestings,coming to sting in the same area --that they're afraid of.And of course, a good matriarchwould always keep her youngaway from such a threat.Young calves have much thinner skins,and it's potentialthat they could be stungthrough their thinner skins.", "So for my PhD,I had this unusual challengeof trying to work outhow African elephantsand African bees would interact,when the theory wasthat they wouldn't interact at all.How was I going to study this?Well, what I did was I took the soundof disturbed African honey bees,and I played it back to elephantsresting under treesthrough a wireless speaker system,so I could understand how they would reactas if there were wild bees in the area.And it turns out that they reactquite dramaticallyto the sound of African wild bees.Here we are, playing the bee soundsback to this amazing group of elephants.You can see the ears going up, going out,they're turning their headsfrom side to side,one elephant is flicking her trunkto try and smell.There's another elephantthat kicks one of calves on the groundto tell it to get upas if there is a threat.And one elephant triggers a retreat,and soon the whole family of elephantsare running after heracross the savannah in a cloud of dust.", "(Sound of bees buzzing)", "(Sound of bees ends)", "Now I've done this experimentmany, many times,and the elephants almost always flee.Not only do they run away,but they dust themselvesas they're running,as if to knock bees out of the air.And we placed infrasonic microphonesaround the elephantsas we did these experiments.And it turns out they're communicatingto each other in infrasonic rumblesto warn each other of the threat of beesand to stay away from the area.", "So these behavioral discoveriesreally helped us understandhow elephants would reactshould they hear or see bee sounds.This led me to invent a novel designfor a beehive fence,which we are now building around small,one-to-two-acre farmson the most vulnerablefrontline areas of Africawhere humans and elephantsare competing for space.These beehive fencesare very, very simple.We use 12 beehives and 12 dummy hivesto protect one acre of farmland.Now a dummy hiveis simply a piece of plywoodwhich we cut into squares, paint yellowand hang in between the hives.We're basically tricking the elephantsinto thinking there are more beehivesthan there really are.And of course, it literallyhalves the cost of the fence.So there's a hive and a dummy hiveand a beehive and now dummy hive,every 10 metersaround the outside boundary.They're held up by postswith a shade roof to protect the bees,and they're interconnectedwith a simple piece of plain wire,which goes all the way around,connecting the hives.", "So if an elephant tries to enter the farm,he will avoid the beehive at all cost,but he might try and push throughbetween the hive and the dummy hive,causing all the beehives to swingas the wire hits his chest.And as we know from our research work,this will cause the elephantsto flee and run away --and hopefully remembernot to come back to that risky area.The bees swarm out of the hive,and they really scare the elephants away.", "These beehive fences we're studyingusing things like camera trapsto help us understandhow elephants are respondingto them at night time,which is when mostof the crop raiding occurs.And we found in our study farmsthat we're keepingup to 80 percent of elephantsoutside of the boundaries of these farms.And the bees and the beehive fencesare also pollinating the fields.So we're having a great reductionboth in elephant crop raidsand a boost in yieldthrough the pollination servicesthat the bees are givingto the crops themselves.", "The strength of the beehive fencesis really important --the colonies have to be very strong.So we're trying to help farmersgrow pollinator-friendly cropsto boost their hives,boost the strength of their beesand, of course, producethe most amazing honey.This honey is so valuable as an extralivelihood income for the farmers.It's a healthy alternative to sugar,and in our community,it's a very valuable presentto give a mother-in-law,which makes it almost priceless.", "(Laughter)", "We now bottle up this honey,and we've called this wild beautiful honeyElephant-Friendly Honey.It is a fun name,but it also attractsattention to our projectand helps people understandwhat we're trying to doto save elephants.We're working now with so many womenin over 60 human-elephant conflict sitesin 19 countries in Africa and Asiato build these beehive fences,working very, very closelywith so many farmersbut particularly now with women farmers,helping them to live betterin harmony with elephants.", "One of the things we're trying to dois develop a toolbox of optionsto live in better harmonywith these massive pachyderms.One of those issuesis to try and get farmers,and women in particular,to think differentabout what they're plantinginside their farms as well.So we're looking at planting cropsthat elephants don't particularlywant to eat, like chillies,ginger, Moringa, sunflowers.And of course, the bees and the beehivefences love these crops too,because they have beautiful flowers.One of these plantsis a spiky plant called sisal --you may know this here as jute.And this amazing plantcan be stripped downand turned into a weaving product.", "We're working with these amazing women nowwho live daily withthe challenges of elephantsto use this plant to weave into basketsto provide an alternative income for them.We've just started constructiononly three weeks agoon a women's enterprise centerwhere we're going to be workingwith these womennot only as expert beekeepersbut as amazing basket weavers;they're going to be processingchili oils, sunflower oils,making lip balms and honey,and we're somewhere on our wayto helping these participating farmerslive with better eco-generating

"一个问题是，你可以只是开始建造电围栏，整个非洲现在都在这么做，我们看到越来越多的社区采用这样的“解决方式”。但是他们正在划分区域、堵塞通道。我现在告诉你，这些大象不会思考这么多，尤其是，如果社区堵住一条极为特殊的——大象需要在那里涉水——的水坑，或是在过道另一边，有一头很有吸引力的母象。破坏那些围栏杆子并不费劲。只要围栏有个空档缺口，大象们就会走回去，告诉它们的同伴，突然之间，所有的大象都穿过了围栏，于是现在，被围栏包围的社区内有 12 头大象。你现在是真的遇到麻烦了。关于电围栏的设计不断推陈出新，然而这些大象，并不会思考那么多。", "（笑声）", "所以除了使用这些强硬的、直接的、带电流的，十分具有分裂性的防迁移围栏之外，一定还有其他的方法来克服这个挑战。为了在必要时候能把人和大象分开，我对整体和自然的解决方案更感兴趣。只是与人们交谈，和肯尼亚北部的有着丰富灌木知识的乡村牧民交谈，我们发现牧民口中的大象不会以有着野生蜂巢的树木为食。这是一个很有意思的故事。当大象在树上觅食时，它们会折断树枝也可能会破开野蜂窝。于是这些蜜蜂会飞出它们的自然巢穴并且蜇大象。", "如果大象被蜜蜂叮了，它们可能会记住这棵树是危险的并且再也不会回到这个地方。刺穿大象厚厚的皮肤看似不可能——大象皮肤大约有 2 厘米厚。但是蜜蜂蜇大象，似乎都是在水域附近、眼部周围、耳朵后方、嘴巴里面，象鼻上方。你能想象大象会很快记住这个“被叮”的体验。而且让它们害怕的不仅是一次叮咬。非洲蜜蜂有一个惊人的能力：当它们叮咬某一处时，会释放一种能够吸引其他蜜蜂来同处叮咬的信息素。所以大象害怕的不是被一只蜜蜂蜇——可能是上千的蜜蜂前来叮咬同一个地方——这是它们所害怕的。当然，一个优秀的女族长一直都会保护小象，让它们免受如此的威胁。幼崽们的皮肤薄得多，它们被叮的话，很有可能会刺穿它们较薄的皮肤。", "所以，我的博士学位有着不同寻常的挑战——在非洲大象和非洲蜜蜂毫无互动的理论背景下，尝试找到它们的相互作用机制。我要怎么进行这项研究？我做的一件事，是拿着被扰乱的非洲蜜蜂的音带，跑到在树下休息的大象耳边利用无线扬声器系统播放此音带，来了解假设这块区域有野生蜜蜂，大象会如何反应。结果是，这些大象对非洲蜜蜂的声音反应很大。我们看看，重复在这群大象耳边播放蜜蜂的音带。你可以看到它们的耳朵竖了起来，它们在左右摇晃脑袋，一头大象在甩动鼻子尝试着闻气味。还有一头大象踢了一下地上的一头幼崽，告诉它快站起来，宛如威胁正在逼近。之后一头大象发出撤退指令，很快整个大象家族都跟着它撤退，在尘埃中穿越稀树大草原。", "（蜜蜂嗡嗡叫声）", "（蜜蜂叫声结束）", "我已经做过这个实验好几次了，大象几乎每次都会逃跑。它们不仅会逃跑，而且会在逃跑的时候用尘土弄脏自己，好像想要把蜜蜂从自己的身上拍掉。在进行这些实验时，我们把次声传声器放置在大象周围。后来发现它们在次声波段隆隆低语地交流来警告彼此蜜蜂的威胁并且远离蜜蜂所在区域。", "所以这些行为的发现确实帮助我们了解了大象在被蜜蜂声音包围的时候会做出怎样的反应。这启发我发明了一种新颖的围栏设计——蜂巢围栏。我们现在正在非洲最脆弱的、人象空间争夺严重的前线地区，围绕着 1 - 2 英亩的小农场建造这样的围栏。这些蜂巢围栏非常非常简单。我们用 12 个蜂巢和 12 个假蜂巢来保护 1 英亩的农田。一个假蜂巢只是一块被切成正方形、涂成黄色，并且悬挂在蜂巢间的胶合板。我们基本上是在捉弄大象，希望它们认为这里有比实际数量更多的蜂巢。当然，这能削减围栏一半的成本。所以是一个真一个假，再一个真，再一个假蜂巢，每隔 10 米，放在围栏之外。这些蜂巢被带有遮阳棚顶的柱子所支撑，以保护蜜蜂，用一根钢丝把它们连接起来，串联整圈的蜂巢。", "如果一头大象尝试着进入农场，它将会不遗余力地避开蜂巢，但是它可能会尝试从真假蜂巢的间隙处通过，当它的胸部触碰到钢丝时，所有蜂巢会同时晃动。而且根据我们的研究，我们知道大象会因此逃跑——希望它们会记得不要再回到这块危险的区域。蜜蜂从蜂巢中涌出，它们真的能把大象们吓走。", "我们使用相机陷阱等技术在研究这些蜂巢围栏，来帮助我们理解大象在夜间碰到围栏会有何反应。夜间是大多数农作物被侵袭的时候。而且在我们进行研究的农场中，我们发现我们正把高达 80% 的大象隔离在这些农场边界外。这些蜜蜂和蜂巢围栏也同时在给土地传授花粉。所以我们的设计同时减少了大象对农作物的侵袭，并且通过蜜蜂给农作物授粉，刺激了农场产量。", "蜂巢围栏的强度很重要——蜂群需要非常强健。所以我们正在尝试帮助农民种植授粉友好的作物，来加强加固它们的蜂巢，增强蜜蜂的力量，当然，还有生产最佳的蜂蜜。作为农民额外的生计收入，这个蜂蜜是如此宝贵。这是糖的健康替代品，而且在我们社区，蜂蜜是一个给岳母/婆婆非常珍贵的礼物，这几乎是无价之宝。", "（笑声）", "我们现在将这蜂蜜密封到瓶中，我们把这野生美丽的蜂蜜称之为大象友好蜂蜜。这是一个风趣的名字，但也吸引了不少人对我们项目的关注并且帮助人们了解我们正在尝试做的事情——拯救大象。我们现在和许多女性合作，在非洲和亚洲的 19 个国家，60 余存在人象矛盾的地点建造这些蜂巢围栏，非常紧密地和许多农民协作，主要是女性农民，在帮助她们建立一个与大象和平共处的生活。", "我们在做的一件事就是开发一个选项工具箱使人们能更好地和这些巨型厚皮动物和谐相处。其中的一个问题就是让农民加入我们的行列，尤其是女性，从不同角度思考他们正在自己的农场中种着什么作物。所以我们寻找一种大象通常不会想要吃的作物，例如辣椒、姜、辣木，和向日葵。当然，蜜蜂和蜂巢围栏也非常喜爱这些作物，因为这些作物会长出美丽的花。其中的一种带刺的植物，名为剑麻——你可能知道它的“黄麻布料”身份。这种奇妙的植物可以砍下来制成织物。", "我们正在在和这些优秀的女性合作。她们每天的生活都受到了大象的挑战，现在她们用这种植物编织成篮筐作为她们的一种替代收入。我们在 3 周前在女性企业中心刚刚开始动工。在那里，我们将要和这些女性协作，不仅作为专业养蜂人，还作为技艺精湛的篮筐编织者；她们将会生产辣椒油、葵花籽油，制造润唇膏和蜂蜜，而我们也在帮助这些参与项目的农民打造生态驱动项目，以至于他们和大象共存的同时，能过上更好的生活，做更好的工作。", "所以不论是女族长，母亲，或是像我这样的研究人员，我确实看到更多的女性到前线来为我们面对的挑战提供更加不同且大胆的想法。随着更多的创新，可能还有对彼此更多的一些共鸣，我确实相信我们可以从一个人象矛盾之国转变为可以真正人象共存的国家。", "谢谢。", "（掌声）" ] } }

vicious cycle.If born poor, it can takethree or more generationsto escape one.Many are forced in this cyclewithout choices,to live on pavements,along train tracks,in dumping grounds,along rivers,swamps and many such unlivable spaces,without clean water, toilets or housing.", "But these places are not unfamiliar to me,because since the age of six,I accompanied my father, a doctor,who treated patientsin the slums of Bombay.Growing up, I would help himcarry his bag of medicinesafter school lessons --I loved doing that.Wanting to do somethingabout these habitats,I decided to become an architect.But quite early on, I realizedthat the beauty of architecturewas only for the rich.So I decided to do urban planningand joined an NGO in Indiathat works with the urban poorwho organize themselvesto access basic services,such as water, sanitation and housing,for the poor living in cities.", "Now I spent 10 years of my lifein professional education, in learning,and then five years in unlearning it.Because I realizedthat all my training in architecture,design and planningfailed ground realities.And this is where I learnedthe power of choice.I unlearned many things,but there are two myths about the poorthat I would like to sharethat we live with.", "The first myth is a perceptionthat migration of poor peopleinto cities is a problem.Is migration really a choice?My mentor Sheela Patelasked to those who thinkof this as a problem,\"Go ask your grandfatherwhere he came from,\" she says.", "So what do poor people dowhen they migrate in cities?Let me share an example.This is the Mumbai International Airport.All that you see in blueare large informal settlements around it.Close to 75,000 people live here.So who are these peoplethat work silently in hotels, restaurants,as laborers, babysitters, house helpsand countless other jobsthat we need for cities to functionwithout a glitch?And where do they live?In most cities, they live in slums.So let us think again.Do we want poor peopleto stop migrating in our cities?What if they had a choice of not to?", "The second myth is my personal experience.It's this attitude that weprofessionals know better.We professionals loveto make choices for others,especially for the poor.Let me share an experience.In a workshop that looked at designing250 new houses for poor familiesfrom a slum nearby,there were different building materialsthat were presented,ranging from papier-mâché,cardboard, honeycomb, etc.,simply because they were affordable.But there was this one ideathat was of shipping containers.Now we immediately approved of it,because we thought it was sustainable,scalable, affordable.But during this presentation,a lady from the slum humbly spoke up.And she asked the presenter,\"Would you choose to live in it?\"", "(Laughter)", "\"If not, then why did you think we would?\"Now this was a personalunlearning moment for me,where I realized that povertyonly changes affordability --it does not change aspirations.", "Now poor people have livedin temporary structures all their life.They go from wall to wall,moving from bricks to tin.They move from building from bamboo,tarpaulin sheets, plastic,to cardboard, to tin,to bricks and cement,just like the way we do.So somewhere here, we were forcingour choices on them.So should we force our choices on them,or should we broaden their choices?", "Now what if the opportunity to choosewas given to people?These are women who lived on the pavementsof a neighborhood in Mumbai.Now they faced constant evictions,and in response to it,they organized a women's networkcalled Mahila Milan.Not only did they fight against evictionswith those in power,saved money and bought land,but they also designedand helped construct their own houses.Well, these were illiterate women,so how did they do that?They used floor mats and saristo understand measurements.A sari is four meters in lengthand 1.5 meters in width.They used these simple day-to-day itemsto demonstrate house models.And even they madethree options to choose fromand invited all their fellow residentsto come and have a look.", "(Laughter)", "And everybody loved this optionthat had a loft in it,simply because it did two things.One is that it accommodatedlarger families to sleep in.And two, it allowed home-based work,such as bangle-making, jewelry-designing,embroidery-stitching,packaging items, etc.Now they also decidedto not have a toilet inside,but instead have it outsidein the corridors,simply because it gave themmore space and it was cheaper.Now, professionalscould have never thoughtof something like that.A formal design would have necessitatedto have a toilet inside.", "Now these are smaller examples --let me share some larger context:881,000,000 people --that's about one sixth of this world,as we talk here --are living in slumsand informal settlements.Almost every city in the global southhas large slums in the size of townships.Kibera, in Nairobi,Dharavi, in Mumbai,Khayelitsha in South Africa, just a few.Now initially, they were allon waste and abandoned landsthat cities were never interested in.As cities grew,poor people started buildingon these landsand brought value to this over time.And today, these lands have becomereal estate hot spotsthat everybody wants a piece of.", "So how do cities and those in powerchoose to deal with them?They demolish them and evict themand move them awayfrom their cities and economiesin order to build a new infrastructure.They move them into vertical housing,which in reality looks like this.Now when built in high densities,they lack natural light and ventilation,and it often leadsto unhealthy conditions.", "Now, on one hand,poor people are not involvedin the participation of design,and there is poor quality of construction.And on the other hand,they do not understandhow to do maintenance,you know, keeping bills,keeping records, forming societies --this is always difficult for them.And being forced to moveinto this formal society,they end up looking like thisin a few years.Because formalization is not a product,it's a process.Moving from informal to formalfor poor people is a journey.It takes time to accept and adapt.And when that choice is not given,it becomes like this,which I'm afraid, in future,these would become the slums.", "Now instead of doing this,what if we accommodated poor peopleand gave them a choiceto be a part of our citiesand develop them where they are,giving them basic services,like in this picture?Now what happens if citiesand governments could work together,if governments acknowledge poor people,and they could build it together?", "This is Mukuru.It's a large informalsettlement in Nairobi.It's one of the largestsettlements in Africa.It's home to 300,000 peopleliving over 650 acres of land.To help us understand that scale,it's like squeezingthe population of Pittsburghinto the New York Central Park.That's Mukuru.So to give us a glimpse,this is the condition of housing.And this is what it is in between them.", "So what is life in Mukuru like,just talking briefly?Five hundred and fifty peopleuse one single water tapand pay nine times morethan what anybody elsein the city could pay,simply because there isno water infrastructureand water is sold.Many come back from work to find outthat their houses do not exist,because they have either been bulldozed,or they have been burned down.So, tired of this situation,a local slum dwellers' federationcalled Muunganodecided to do something about it.In four years,they organized 20,000 residentsto collect data,map structures and put it together.And the plan was very simple --they only needed four things.They wanted clean water,toilets, decent roadsand, most importantly, not to be evicted.", "So they presented thiswith the government of Nairobi.And for the first time in history ever,a city has agreed to do it.The city of Nairobi,the government of Kenya,declared Mukuruto be a special planning area,which means that peoplecould come up with their own plan.People could decide to come upwith their own norms and standards,because the standards that workfor the formal citizensdo not work in informal settings.", "So what does that mean,to give us an instance?If these are roads in Mukuru,you can see that there are housesalong both sides of the road.Now in order to bring in a city bus,as per the standards,planners would have gone fora luxurious 25-meter-wide road.Now that would mean displacing[25] percent of the structures --that's a lot of people.So instead of doing that,we came up with a 12-meter-wide road,which had the structures intactand brought the city buswithout compromisingon much services.", "In another instance,let's talk about community toilets.You know, in high-density areas,where there is no scopefor individual toilets,like the public toilets that we have here.So we would go for a male sectionand a female section.But imagine this situation.In the morning rush hours to the toilet,when everybody is in intensepressure to relieve themselves,and if you're standingin a queue of 50 people,and there is a childstanding behind an adult,who wins?Children end up squatting outside.And that's why women decidedto come up with a separatesquatting area for children.Now, who could have thoughtof something like that?", "The idea here isthat when poor people choose,they choose better.They choose what works for them.So choice is everything.And power decides choice.And we need those in power --politicians, leaders, governments,architects, planners,institutions, researchers --and all of us in our everyday livesto respect choices.Instead of choosing what is rightfor people, for the poor,let's acknowledgeand empower their choices.And that is how we can buildbetter and inclusive cities for tomorrow,completing the imagery of citiesbuilt by the choices of its own people.", "Thank you.", "(Applause)" ], "zh-cn" : [ "我们眼中的城市是什么样的？当我们想到城市时，脑海中通常会有这样的画面。但是你们看到的并不是全貌，还有城中之城。这一部分的城市常常被视作为贫民窟、非法居住区、非正式居民区，而居住在里面的人们则被称为非法的、非正式的、罪犯、靠救济存活、乞丐等等。但是事实上，这些是别无选择的穷人。", "贫穷是一个恶性循环。如果生而贫困，则需要三代或更多代才能脱离贫困。许多人被迫活在这样的循环中，别无选择，只能住在人行道上、铁轨旁、垃圾场里、河边、沼泽以及许多像这样不宜生活的地方，没有干净用水、厕所或住房。", "但是对我而言，这些地方并不陌生，因为从六岁起，我就跟随身为医生的父亲，在孟买的贫民窟医治病人。成长过程中，我会在下课后帮他背装满药品的袋子——我乐在其中。我想要为这些地方做些什么，于是我决定成为一名建筑师。但是从很早开始，我就意识到建筑的美感只是属于有钱人的。所以我决定从事城市规划行业，并加入了印度的一个非政府组织（NGO），该组织和城市中的穷人合作，他们通常会自发组织起来以获取基本的服务，向生活在城市中的穷人提供水、卫生和住房。", "我花了 10 年时间接受专业的教育，然后花了 5 年时间忘记所学。因为我意识到，我在建筑、设计和规划上受过的训练，都与现实是脱节的。此时，我学到了选择的力量。我忘记了很多事情，但是关于穷人，有两个迷思与我们息息相关，我想要分享给大家。", "第一个迷思是，在人们的观念中，穷人涌入城市是一个问题。人口迁移真的是一种选择吗？我的导师舍拉 · 帕特（Sheela Patel）曾向那些认为这是个问题的人发问，她说，“问问你的祖父他来自哪里。”", "当穷人搬入城市时，他们会做什么？让我分享一个例子。这是孟买国际机场。你们看到的蓝色区域是围绕在其周边的大型非正式社区。将近七万五千人在这里生活。那么，那些默默无闻地在酒店、餐厅工作，从事着劳工、保姆、家庭帮手以及数不清的其他工作，确保城市顺利运作的人，他们是谁？他们住在哪里？在大多数城市中，他们住在贫民窟。那么让我们再思考一下，我们想要穷人停止迁入我们的城市吗？如果他们可以选择是否迁入，那会怎么样？", "第二个迷思来自我的个人经历。也就是专业人士懂得更多的这种态度。我们专业人士喜欢为他人做选择，特别是对穷人。以我的个人经历为例，在一个为周边贫民窟的贫困家庭设计 250 座新房的工作坊上，人们展示了不同的建筑材料，包括混凝纸浆、纸板、蜂巢等等，仅仅因为这些材料更廉价。但有一个主意是使用集装箱。我们立刻就同意了这个想法，因为我们觉得这是可持续、可以扩大规模且可负担的。但是在展示过程中，一位来自贫民窟的女士谦虚地发声了。她问了展示人，“你会选择住在里面吗？”", "（笑声）", "“如果你不会，你为什么觉得我们会？”那一刻让我意识到要忘记所学，我发现，贫困只改变了人能负担什么——贫困没有改变人的志向。", "穷人的一生都生活在临时建筑中。他们从一面墙换到另一面，从砖块房屋换到铁桶搭成的屋子。他们从用竹子、防水布、塑料搭建房屋，换成用纸板和铁桶，最后改进到用砖块和水泥，就像我们一样。某种程度上，我们把我们的选择强加给了他们。那么，我们是应该把自己的选择强加给他们，还是应该拓宽他们选择的余地呢？", "如果人们被赋予了选择的机会，那会怎么样？这些是生活在孟买一个社区的人行道上的女人。为了应对她们所面临的无休止的驱逐，她们创立了一个女性组织，叫做“团结的女性”（Mahila Milan）。她们不仅与权势的驱逐作斗争、存钱并买地，还设计并协助搭建她们自己的房子。这些都是不识字的女人，她们是如何做到的？她们把地板垫和莎丽服当作量尺。一件莎丽服长 4 米，宽 1.5 米。她们使用这些简单的日常物件来展示房屋模型。她们甚至设计了三种格局以供选择，并邀请邻居来参观。", "（笑声）", "每个人都喜欢这个有阁楼的布局，仅因为它有两个特点。一是，它能容纳下更大的家庭。二是，它允许家庭作坊式的工作，比如手镯制作、珠宝设计、刺绣、包装物件等等。他们还决定不在里面安置厕所，而是把厕所设在外面的走廊，因为这样会有更多的空间，还更便宜。专业人员根本不可能有这样的考量。正式的设计一定会把厕所放在屋内。", "这些是较小的例子——还有更大规模的情形：8 亿 8100 万人——我们说的是全世界将近六分之一的人口——居住在贫民窟或是非正式居民区。几乎南半球的每个城市，都有市镇规模的大型贫民窟。内罗毕的基贝拉，孟买的达拉维，南非的卡亚利沙，这只是其中几个例子。一开始，它们都位于被废弃的土地上，城市对这些土地一直没什么兴趣。随着城市规模的扩大，穷人开始在这些土地上建设，逐渐给这些土地带来了价值。而今天，这些土地变成了炙手可热的房地产资源，每个人都想分一杯羹。", "那么，城市和有权势的人选择怎么处理它们呢？他们拆除建筑，驱逐居民，把穷人从他们的城市和经济体中赶走，以建筑新的基础设施。他们让穷人搬进垂直型建筑，现实中看上去是这样。高密度的建筑缺乏良好的采光和通风条件，通常会损害健康。", "一方面，穷人没有参与到设计之中，建筑的质量也不好。另一方面，他们不懂得如何维护保养，比如保留账单、保持记录、形成社区——这些对他们来说总是很难。他们被迫搬入这种正式的社区，在几年后便会成为这样。因为正式化并不是一种产物，而是一个过程。对穷人来说，从非正式移入正式是一个旅程，需要时间去接受和适应。而当没有选择时，便会成为这样，恐怕将来这些地方会变成贫民窟。", "但我们还有别的选择，如果我们给穷人提供住房，给予他们成为我们城市一部分的选择，开发他们所在的地区，为他们提供像图中这样的基础设施，那会怎么样呢？如果城市和政府可以合作，如果政府认可穷人，穷人可以参与建设，会发生什么？", "这是穆库鲁。内罗毕的一个大型非正式居民区，也是非洲最大的居民区之一。这是 30 万人的家园，他们在 263 公顷的土地上生活。为了帮助大家理解这一规模，这相当于把匹兹堡的人口挤到纽约的中央公园里面。这就是穆库鲁。我们看看，这就是当地的住房条件，以及房屋之间的样子。", "那么简单来说，穆库鲁的生活是怎么样的呢？550 个人共用一个水龙头，而且相比城市中的人，要付九倍的价钱，仅是因为那里没有水利基础设施，水是用来卖的。许多人下班回来，发现他们的房子不见了，因为这些房子要么被推倒了，要么被烧掉了。所以，在厌倦了这样的情形之后，一个名为“穆加农”（Muungano）的当地贫民窟居民联盟决定行动起来改变现状。四年间，他们组织了两万居民收集数据、绘制设施图并把它们整合起来。方案非常简单——他们只要四样东西——清洁的用水、厕所、像样的道路，以及最重要的，不被驱逐。", "他们向内罗毕政府展示了这个方案。有史以来第一次，城市同意了这个方案。内罗毕市和肯尼亚政府宣布穆库鲁成为特别规划区域，这意味着人们可以提出他们自己的方案。人们可以制定出他们自己的规范和标准，因为适用于正规居民的标准并不适用于非正式社区。", "那么这意味着什么？举个例子来看。如果这些是穆库鲁的道路，你可以看到在道路的两旁都有房屋。为了引入城市公交，根据标准，规划者会选择很奢侈的25 米宽的道路。这意味着会占去 25% 的建筑——很多人会失去房子。所以我们不这么修路，而是选择了 12 米宽的道路，这保持了建筑的完整，同时引入了城市公交，而没有牺牲掉过多的服务。", "再来看看社区厕所，你们知道，在人口密度高的地方，厕所没有办法设置独立隔间，像我们这里的公共厕所那样。我们考虑分为男厕所和女厕所。但是思考下这个情形。在早晨上厕所的高峰时刻，每个人都着急的要“解压”，如果你站在 50 人的队伍里，有个孩子站在成人后面，谁会获胜？孩子最终会在外面蹲着上厕所。这就是为什么女性决定给孩子设置专门分开的蹲厕区。有谁会想到这些呢？", "这里的关键在于，当穷人做选择时，他们能做出更好的选择。他们的选择对他们更适用。所以选择权就是全部，而权力决定选择权。我们需要那些掌权的人——政客、领导、政府、建筑师、规划者、机构和研究人员——以及我们生活中的所有人去尊重选择。不要为穷人选择什么是对的，而是承认并赋予他们选择的权利。这样，我们才能为将来建造出更好、更包容、构建在城市自身居民选择之上的城市，让城市的形象变得更加完整。",

going to geta really good slide across that floor.Good luck trying to do that barefoot.Master manipulators of friction.", "All kids are tribologists.What about us as adults?At some point today,you brushed your teeth.I hope.", "(Laughter)", "This is tribology in action.The toothpaste and toothbrushare working to remove or wearthe plaque from your teeth.For the record, my dad is a dentist.Never thought my career was goingto circle back to the family business.But one day, we found ourselvesspeaking the same languagewhen I was tasked with developing a testto investigate plaque removal.Sounded simple enough,until I started to look at itas a tribologist,and then it became incredibly complex.You have hard materials --those would be your teeth --soft materials like your gums,the toothpaste, the toothbrush.There's lubrication --the form of saliva and water --the dynamics of the persondoing the brushing and more.I promise if we put diamondsin your toothpaste,you're going to remove that plaque.Probably going to removeyour teeth as well.So there's a fine balance to be hadbetween wearing the plaque awayand not damaging your teeth and gums.", "We're brushing our teeth because we ate.Eating is another routine thing we all do.Seems simple enough.But it's another field of tribology,and it's not so simple.You have the food, which will breakand wear while you're eating,and that food is interactingwith your teeth, your tongue,your saliva, your throat.And all of those interactions are goingto influence your experience of eating.I think you can all recall a momentwhere you tried something newand you just found yourself going,\"Well, it tastes alright.I really don't like that texture.\"Tribologists are looking at lubricity,the coefficient of friction,as ways to connect mouth feeland texture to what you're experiencing,so that if we're changing the formulationsof what we're eating and drinkingso the sugar contentor fat content are different,how does that change mouth feel?How do we quantify that?This is what tribologistsare looking to solve.And while my colleagueswere in one corner of this lablooking at the fat content of yogurt,I was in another cornerstudying dog

really should bebrushing their teeth,and more pet ownersare starting to do this.I know my best friend is really greatat brushing her cat's teeth, somehow.Good luck trying to do that with my cat.So what pet food suppliersare trying to dois incorporate plaque removalin things like treats.If you have a dog,you may have observedthat you give a dog a treat,and it magically seems to disappearafter just one bite.So the added challenge here is:How do you remove plaquewhen you have one bite?I developed a benchtop testto study this problem,and to do so, I had to mimicthe oral system of dogs:their teeth, plaque, saliva.And I used friction and wear measurementsto study the effectivenessof that treat on removing plaque.If you're sitting there right nowthinking about the last timeyou didn't brush your dog's teeth,you're very welcome.", "But what's the big deal with tribology?Let me give you one more example.No matter where you are right now,you got to this location somehow.Maybe you walked or rode your bike,but for most people in this room,you probably came in a car.Just think about allthe tribological systems in a car.You have your personalinteractions with the car,the car's interactions with the roadand everything under the hoodand in the drivetrain.Some routine maintenanceis directly connected to tribology.You know how many milesyour tires are recommended for usingbefore you replace them.You regularly checkthe treads on those tires.You're actively monitoringthe wear of your tires.Tribology is the studyof wear and friction,and with tires, friction can bethe difference between a safe arrivaland a car accident.This is because the frictionbetween your tires and the roadwill influence your acceleration,your decelerationand your stopping distance.As a driver, you instinctivelyalready know how important friction is,because you knowthat when the roads are wet,they're more dangerousbecause they're slippery.This is because the wateris reducing the frictionbetween your tires and the road.You may recall that frictionis the force that opposes motion,so water reducing that forcemeans it's now easier for you to move,hence it's more slipperywhen the roads are wet.", "Something else to consideris that overcoming friction takes energy,so you're losing energy to friction.This is one way your tirescan influence your fuel efficiency.And, in fact, did you knowthat about one-third of the fuelthat you put into yourinternal combustion engine vehiclewill be spent overcoming friction?One-third.", "Tribology researchhas helped us reduce frictionand therefore increasefuel efficiency and reduce emissions.Holmberg and Erdemir have actuallydone some great studiesshowing the impacttribology research can haveon reducing our energy consumption.And they found that, looking overthe span of 20 years,we had the opportunity to reducethe energy consumptionof passenger vehiclesup to 60 percent.When you think aboutall the cars in the world,that's a lot of energy we can save.It's part of the nearly nine percentof our current global energy consumptionthat the authors identifiedtribology can help us save.That's a significant amount of energy.So when you look at the numbers,tribology can do some amazing things.", "My colleagues have identifiedup to 20 quads of energywe can save across the US alone.To put this in perspective:one quad of energy is roughly equivalentto 180 million barrels of oil,and tribology can help ussave 20 times that.This is through new materials,new lubricants,novel component design,doing things like making wind turbinesmore efficient and reliable.This happened just by putting31 people in a roomwho viewed the worldthrough a tribology lens.Imagine the opportunitiesthat will reveal themselvesas more of us start to seetribology all around.", "My favorite projects right noware in aerospace applications.I love reducing wear and frictionin these challenging environments.I can make materials and partsthat will reduce the frictionin moving components and enginesso that they have less forceopposing their motion.Less force to movemeans they require less power,so you can use a smaller actuator,which would weigh less,which saves fuel.I can also help make partsthat last longer through lower wear.This will reduce material wasteand also means we're manufacturingthe parts less frequently,so we're saving energy in manufacturing.", "I encourage you to start seeingtribology in the world around youand to think about how you would improvethose interacting surfaces you experience.Even the smallest improvementsreally add up.Tribology may be a funny-sounding word,but it has a huge impact on our world.", "Thank you.", "(Applause)" ], "zh-cn" : [ "当人们问我做什么工作时，我得承认答案很有趣。因为我告诉他们，我就是拿物品相互摩擦。只是拿东西相互摩擦，听起来很荒唐。", "但是它有一个技术别称：摩擦学。T-r-i-b-o-l-o-g-y，源自古希腊语：“tribos”，意思是“摩擦”。你可能从来没听过这个有些好笑的词，但是我向你保证，探索它，将会改变你对物质世界的体验。摩擦学给了我机会去从事许多很棒的项目。我研究过飞行器材料，也研究过狗粮——除非你开始以摩擦学的眼光来看这个世界，不然这组合一般人很难在几年内同时接触到。我想你们会惊讶于一点摩擦学在解决难题上的重要性。", "摩擦学是研究摩擦力、磨损和润滑的学科。你们都体验过这三个东西。还记得上一次你试着在地板上移动重物的时候，你能够感觉到有东西在阻止你吗？那就是摩擦力。摩擦力是阻碍运动的力。磨损则是指物质的损耗和转移。再喜欢的鞋子，鞋底终究会因磨损殆尽而被淘汰。润滑剂能用来减少摩擦和磨损。它们能松开那些生锈卡死，难以转动的螺栓，", "但是摩擦学也被定义为在相对运动中，表面相互作用的学科。所以，相对运动中的表面相互作用：世界上有很多这样的例子。你现在坐在这里，是不是在活动你的双脚，或者不断改变你的坐姿。因为摩擦学正在起作用。即使你只是在椅子上稍稍挪动，都涉及了两个相对运动的表面。并且你移动的摩擦作用会与你身边的人有所不同。这是因为你所穿的衣服改变了你和座椅之间的摩擦力。如果你穿了丝绸，会比你穿羊毛时在座位上扭动更容易一些。这是因为丝绸的摩擦力小一些。", "你在移动或者扭动脚踝的时候，是不是有发出“咔咔”声？你经历过的，对吧？你起床，走动，一些关节碰撞发声，这都是因为摩擦学。这种声音可能是由于润滑关节的液体中的气泡被释放所导致的。这种声音也可以来自于肌腱之间的相互移动，在脚踝处很常见，所以我那些喜欢扭动脚踝的朋友，会突然对肌腱之间的摩擦学感到好奇。", "但我又是如何成为摩擦学家的呢？当然，这得从小时候说起。我跳着芭蕾舞长大。我可以踮着脚尖起舞，法语里叫“足尖舞 (en pointe)”。当你踮着脚尖跳舞时，你会穿着那漂亮的舞鞋，但是它们可能会让你在舞台上打滑。当你跳舞的时候，最可怕的莫过于滑倒。所以我们会用一种叫松香的东西。我们踩进松香里，舞鞋上就会有一层薄膜。松香来自于树液，粉末状的松香可以防滑。作为一个舞者，你会很快知道应该放多少松香在舞鞋上。因为如果没有放够，你很可能滑倒，因为你的鞋子和舞台之间没有足够的摩擦力。幸运的话，你只是在舞台上看起来手脚不协调，但要是运气不好，你就会受伤。那个时候，我已经在优化和控制摩擦力了。你们看，我注定要成为一个摩擦学家。", "（笑声）", "但是你们也是初级的摩擦学家：当你使用蜡笔和彩铅的时候，你知道你用的力气越大，颜色就会越深。你也知道这意味着你要更加频繁地削笔，因为它们会更快地磨光。", "现在让我们来谈谈那些闪亮的打蜡地板，人人都想在上面滑来滑去。大家都知道如果穿双袜子，滑动起来更加容易。赤脚可就没那么轻松了。多么高明的摩擦力操纵技巧。", "孩子们都是摩擦学家。那么大人呢？各位今天都刷过牙了，但愿如此。", "（笑声）", "这就是摩擦学的作用。牙膏和牙刷的作用是清除或磨掉你牙齿上的污渍。郑重声明，我爸爸是牙医。我从来没有想过自己会追随他的脚步。但是有一天我们发现我们说着相同的话，当时我刚接受了开发牙渍去除测试的任务。听起来很简单，直到我开始以摩擦学家的角度看待它，才发现它非常复杂。其中涉及到坚硬的材料——这就是你的牙齿；软的材料——就像你的牙龈，牙膏和牙刷；润滑物——像是唾液和清水；还有人们刷牙的动作，等等。我保证如果我们在你的牙膏里添加钻石，牙渍便可以去除，很可能还会连你的牙齿一起磨掉。所以需要一个去掉牙斑又不伤害牙齿牙龈的折衷方法。", "我们刷牙是因为我们要吃东西。吃东西是我们另一个日常所需，看起来很简单，但它是摩擦学的另一个领域，并没有那么容易。你吃东西的时候，食物会被破坏和分解。这些食物和你的牙齿，舌头，唾液和喉咙相互作用。所有的这些作用都会影响你的进食体验。我想你们都会想起尝试新事物的时刻，你会发现自己在想：（咀嚼声）“味道还行，但我真的不喜欢这种口感。”摩擦学家研究润滑和摩擦系数，让你体验到的口感和味道得以相辅相成，所以当我们改变饮食配方，不同的糖分含量或者脂肪含量，口感会出现怎样的变化？我们将如何量化这个问题？这就是摩擦学家要解决的问题。当我的同事在实验室的一个角落研究酸奶的糖分含量，我在另外一个角落研究狗粮。顺便说一句，那个实验室闻起来很香。", "我们都会有规律地刷牙，但有几个人会给宠物刷牙？成年动物通常会患牙周病，所以我们应该给它们刷牙。越来越多的宠物主人开始这样做了。我知道我的好朋友很擅长给她的猫咪刷牙。我希望我也能这样。宠物食品供应商正在尝试研发能够去除牙斑的零食。如果你有养狗，你会发现喂狗吃零食，它一口就能吞下去，很神奇。所以更大的挑战在于：如何在一口吃掉大餐的情况下去除牙渍。我开发了一个台式实验来研究这个问题，还模拟了狗的口腔：包括它们的牙齿，牙菌斑和唾液分布。我用通过测量摩擦力和磨损程度来研究餐食对去除牙菌斑的效果。如果各位还在纠结上次没给狗刷牙，不用客气。", "但是摩擦学到底有多重要呢？再举一个例子，不管你现在在哪里，你总有办法到达这里。有人走路或者骑车，但是你们大多数人应该是开车来的。想想车里所有的摩擦系统。你和车有相互作用，车和马路之间也有，以及引擎盖下和传动系统内的一切。定期保养与摩擦学就息息相关，各位都知道轮胎大概跑多少路就需要检查更换，你也会规律地检查车胎胎面。你其实就是在检查轮胎的磨损程度。摩擦学研究的是磨损和摩擦力。而对于轮胎，摩擦力是旅途平安的关键。因为轮胎和路面的摩擦力影响着加速和减速，以及刹车距离。作为司机，你知道摩擦力的重要性。因为你知道路面湿润时，开车更危险，更容易打滑。这是因为雨水降低了轮胎和路面的摩擦力。你们可能还记得，摩擦力是阻碍运动的力，所以雨水降低摩擦力意味着移动更容易，湿润的路面就会更滑。", "另外还有一件事要考虑进去，克服摩擦力需要能量，所以摩擦会损耗能量。这是轮胎影响燃油效率的一种方式。你们知道，其实引擎中三分之一的燃油都消耗在了克服摩擦力上吗？三分之一。", "对摩擦学的研究能帮助我们减少摩擦力，从而提高燃料效率，减少排放。霍尔姆伯格和埃尔德米尔做了一些很棒的研究，显示了摩擦学研究对减少能源消耗的影响。他们发现在过去的 20 年里，我们本有机会减少高达 60% 的车辆能源消耗。想想世界上的所有车辆，我们其实可以节约很多能源。作者认为，摩擦学可以帮助我们节约目前近 9% 的全球能源消耗中的一部分。这是个庞大的数字。只需要看看这些数据，就会发现摩擦学多么了不起。", "我的同事已经发现，单单在美国，我们就可以节约 20 多夸特的能源。解释一下：1 夸特大约相当于 1.8 亿桶石油。而摩擦学可以帮助我们节省相当于 20 倍这个数字的能量。我们可以通过新的材料、新的润滑剂，以及新的组合设计，来提高风力涡轮机的效率和可靠性。只需将 31 个人放到一间屋子里，以摩擦学的角度来观察这个世界。想象一下，随着越来越多的人开始接触摩擦学，这些机会将逐渐展现在我们面前，", "我现在最喜欢的项目是航天应用，尝试在充满挑战的环境里减少损耗和摩擦。我可以制作能够减少运动部件和引擎内部摩擦的材料和零件，以减少运动阻力。摩擦力减小，意味着所需的能量也更少，可以使用更小，更轻，也更节能的驱动器。我制作出的零件因为磨损小也更加耐用。这减少了材料浪费，也意味着我们制造零件的频率会降低，从而节省了生产过程中所消耗的能源。", "我鼓励大家关注身边的摩擦学，并且考虑如何改善自己遇到的相互作用面。即使是最微小的改善，也可能产生积少成多的效果。摩擦学也许听起来滑稽，但它对我们的世界有着很大的影响。", "谢谢。", "（掌声）" ] } }

cream.The second asked about the correlation between crime ratesand gun control legislation.", "Participants with strong math skillswere much more likely to get the first question correct.But despite being mathematically identical,the results for the second question looked totally different.Here, math skills weren’t the best predictorof which participants answered correctly.Instead, another variable the researchers had been tracking came into play:political identity.Participants whose political beliefsaligned with a correct interpretation of the datawere far more likely to answer the problem right.Even the study’s top mathematicianswere 45% more likely to get the second question wrongwhen the correct answer challenged their political beliefs.", "What is it about politics that inspires this kind of illogical error?Can someone’s political identity actually affect their abilityto process information?The answer lies in a cognitive phenomenonthat has become increasingly visible in public life: partisanship.", "While it’s often invoked in the context of politics,partisanship is more broadly defined as a strong preference or biastowards any particular group or idea.Our political, ethnic, religious, and national identitiesare all different forms of partisanship.Of course, identifying with social groupsis an essential and healthy part of human life.Our sense of self is defined not only by who we are as individuals,but also by the groups we belong to.As a result, we’re strongly motivated to defend our group identities,protecting both our sense of self and our

to maintain a positive relationshipwith their group than perceive the world accurately.", "This behavior is especially dangerous in politics.On an individual scale,allegiance to a party allows people to create a political identityand support policies they agree with.But partisan-based cognitive dissonance can lead people to reject evidencethat’s inconsistent with the party line or discredits party

similar views.", "Fortunately, cognitive scientists have uncovered some strategiesfor resisting this distortion filter.One is to remember that you’re probably more biased than you think.So when you encounter new information,make a deliberate effort to push through your initial intuitionand evaluate it analytically.In your own groups, try to make fact-checking and questioning assumptionsa valued

多名美国成年人，测试设计为从某种程度上检测其评估数据集的能力。在这些数学问题中，隐藏着两个几乎相同的问题。这两个问题都使用了相同难度的数据集，且每个问题都有一个客观正确的答案。第一个问题是关于皮疹和一种新护肤霜间的相关性，第二个问题则是关于犯罪率和枪支管制立法间的关系。", "对数学能力强的测试者来说，他们更可能答对第一题。尽管从数学上来看这是两个相同的问题，但第二个问题的答案看起来却大相径庭。这时，数学能力并不能有效预测哪些测试者回答正确。相反，研究人员跟踪的另一个变量发挥了作用：政治认同。对于正确解读数据的结果与其政治信仰一致的参与者来说，他们更容易答对第二题，当正确答案挑战其政治信仰时，即使是这项研究中最顶尖的数学家，也有 45% 的可能会答错第二题。",

"这种行为在政治上尤其危险，从个人层面来看，效忠政党给人们创建了政治身份，并支持他们赞同的政策。但是，基于党派的认知失调会导致人们拒绝接受与政党路线相左或使党领导人名誉扫地的证据。当整个群体为了自己的党派信仰而去篡改事实的时候，会引导并非以事实或正当理由为基础的政策。",

"幸运的是，认知科学家已经发现了一些策略，来反抗这种扭曲过滤。一是要记住，你可能比自己想象的更有偏见。因此，当遇到新信息时，你要有意识地努力推动你最初的直觉，并进行分析性评估。在你自己的团队中，努力将事实核查和质疑假设变成团队文化的重要部分。警告人们得到的可能是错误信息，这也会有所帮助。当你试图说服别人的时候，先肯定他们的价值观，并用他们的语言来阐述问题，会更有助于他们接受你的观点。",

Great artists steal.\"", "(Laughter)", "OK. But steal from what?Well, believe it or not,most of the technology you needto build a tiny robot already exists.The semiconductor industryhas been getting better and betterat making tinier and tinier devices,so at this point they could putsomething like a million transistorsinto the size of a packagethat is occupied by, say,a single-celled paramecium.And it's not just electronics.They can also build little sensors,LEDs,whole communication packagesthat are too small to be seen.", "So that's what we're going to do.We're going to steal that technology.", "Here's a robot.", "(Laughter)",

why not?It's such a beautiful little machine.It's incredibly intelligent,it's got great communication skills,and it's all in a packagethat you can hold in your hand.So we would like to be ableto build

parts.So up near the top,there are these cool little solar cellsthat you shine light on the deviceand it wakes up a little circuitthat's there in the middle.And that circuit can drivea little tiny LEDthat can blink at you and allowsthe OWIC to communicate with you.So unlike your cell phone,the OWIC communicates with light,sort of like a tiny firefly.", "Now, one thing that's pretty coolabout these OWICsis we don't make them one at a time,soldering all the pieces together.We make them in massive parallel.For example, about a millionof these OWICscan fit on a single four-inch wafer.And just like your phonehas different apps,you can have different kinds of OWICs.There can be ones that, say,measure voltage,some that measure temperature,or just have a little light that can blinkat you to tell you that it's there.", "So that's pretty cool,these tiny little devices.And I'd like to tell you about themin a little more detail.But first, I have to tell youabout something else.I'm going to tell you a few thingsabout pennies that you might not know.", "So this one is a little bit older penny.It's got a picture ofthe Lincoln Memorial on the back.But the first thing you might not know,that

that little stickerthat says \"OWIC.\"", "(Laughter)", "That cost about eight cents.", "(Laughter)", "Now, we're very excited aboutthese things for all sorts of reasons.For example, we can use themas little tiny secure smart tags,more identifying than a fingerprint.We're actually putting them insideof other medical instrumentsto give other information,and even starting to think aboutputting them in the brainto listen to neurons one at a time.", "In fact, there's only one thingwrong with these OWICs:it's not a robot.It's just a head.", "(Laughter)", "And I think we'll all agreethat half a robotreally isn't a robot at all.Without the legs,we've got basically nothing.", "MM: OK, so you need the legs, too,if you want to build a robot.Now, here it turns outyou can't just stealsome preexisting technology.If you want legs for your tiny robot,you need actuators, parts that move.They have to satisfya lot of different requirements.They need to be low voltage.They need to be low power, too.But most importantly,they have to be small.If you want to build a cell-sized robot,you need cell-sized legs.Now, nobody knows how to build that.There was no preexisting technologythat meets all of those demands.To make our legs for our tiny robots,we had to make something new.", "So here's what we built.This is one of our actuators,and I'm applying a voltage to it.When I do, you can seethe actuator respond by curling up.Now, this might not look like much,but if we were to put a red blood cellup on the screen, it'd be about that big,so these are unbelievably tiny curls.They're unbelievably small,and yet this device can just bendand unbend, no problem, nothing breaks.So how do we do it?Well, the actuator is madefrom a layer of platinumjust a dozen atoms or so thick.Now it turns out, if you takeplatinum and put it in waterand apply a voltage to it,atoms from the waterwill attach or remove themselvesfrom the surface of the platinum,depending on how much voltage you use.This creates a force,and you can use that forcefor voltage-controlled actuation.The key here was to makeeverything ultrathin.Then your actuator is flexible enoughto bend to these smallsizes without breaking,and it can use the forces that come aboutfrom just attaching or removinga single layer of atoms.", "Now, we don't have to build theseone at a time, either.In fact, just like the OWICs,we can build them massivelyin parallel as well.So here's a couple thousandor so actuators,and all I'm doing is applying a voltage,and they all wave,looking like nothing more than the legsof a future robot army.", "(Laughter)", "So now we've got the brainsand we've got the brawn.We've got the smarts and the actuators.The OWICs are the brains.They give us sensors,they give us power supplies,and they give us a two-waycommunication system via light.The platinum layers are the muscle.They're what's goingto move the robot around.Now we can take those two pieces,put them togetherand start to build our tiny, tiny robots.The first thing we wanted to buildwas something really simple.This robot walks aroundunder user control.In the middle are some solar cellsand some wiring attached to it.That's the OWIC.They're connected to a set of legswhich have a platinum layerand these rigid panels that we put on topthat tell the legs how to fold up,which shape they should take.The idea is that by shooting a laserat the different solar cells,you can choose which leg you want to moveand make the robot walk around.", "Now, of course, we don't build thoseone at a time, either.We build them massivelyin parallel as well.We can build something like one millionrobots on a single four-inch wafer.So, for example, this imageon the left, this is a chip,and this chip has something like10,000 robots on it.Now, in our world, the macro world,this thing looks like it might bea new microprocessor or something.But if you take that chipand you put it under a microscope,what you're going to see arethousands and thousands of tiny robots.", "Now, these robots are still stuck down.They're still attached to the surfacethat we built them on.In order for them to walk around,we have to release them.We wanted to show you how we do that live,how we release the robot army,but the process involveshighly dangerous chemicals,like, really nasty stuff,and we're like a milefrom the White House right now?Yeah. They wouldn't let us do it.So --", "(Laughter)", "so we're going to show youa movie instead. (Laughs)What you're looking at hereare the final stages of robot deployment.We're using chemicalsto etch the substrateout from underneath the robots.When it dissolves, the robots are freeto fold up into their final shapes.Now, you can see here,the yield's about 90 percent,so almost every one of those10,000 robots we build,that's a robot that we candeploy and control later.", "And we can take those robotsand we can put them places as well.So if you look at the movie on the left,that's some robots in water.I'm going to come along with a pipette,and I can vacuum them all up.Now when you inject the robotsback out of that pipette,they're just fine.In fact, these robots are so small,they're small enough to pass throughthe thinnest hypodermic needleyou can buy.Yeah, so if you wanted to,you could inject yourself full of robots.", "(Laughter)", "I think they're into it.", "(Laughter)", "On the right is a robotthat we put in some pond water.I want you to wait for just one second.Ooop!You see that? That was no shark.That was a paramecium.So that's the worldthat these things live in.", "OK, so this is all well and good,but you might be wondering at this point,\"Well, do they walk?\"Right? That's what they're supposed to do.They better. So let's find out.", "So here's the robot and hereare its solar cells in the middle.Those are those little rectangles.I want you to look at the solar cellclosest to the top of the slide.See that little white dot?That's a laser spot.Now watch what happenswhen we start switching that laserbetween differentsolar cells on the robot.Off it goes!", "(Applause)", "Yeah!", "(Applause)", "Off goes the robotmarching around the microworld.Now, one of the thingsthat's cool about this movie is:I'm actually pilotingthe robot in this movie.In fact, for six months, my job wasto shoot lasers at tiny cell-sized robotsto pilot them around the microworld.This was actually my job.As far as I could tell, that isthe coolest job in the world.", "(Laughter)", "It was just the feelingof total excitement,like you're doing the impossible.It's a feeling of wonder like that firsttime I looked through a microscopeas a kid staring at that rotifer.", "Now, I'm a dad, I have a son of my own,and he's about three years old.But one day, he's going to lookthrough a microscope like that one.And I often wonder:What is he going to see?Instead of just watching the microworld,we as humans can now buildtechnology to shape it,to interact with it, to engineer it.In 30 years, when my son is my age,what will we do with that ability?Will microrobots live in our bloodstream,as common as bacteria?Will they live on our cropsand get rid of pests?Will they tell us when we have infections,or will they fight cancer cell by cell?", "PM: And one cool part is,you're going to be able to participatein this revolution.Ten years or so from now,when you buy your new iPhone 15x Motoor whatever it's called --", "(Laughter)", "it may come with a little jarwith a few thousand tiny robots in itthat you can controlby an app on your cell phone.So if you want to ridea paramecium, go for it.If you want to -- I don't know --DJ the world's smallest robot dance party,make it happen.", "(Laughter)", "And I, for one, am very excitedabout that day coming.", "MM: Thank you.", "(Applause)" ] } }

nation in conflict.Local revolutionaries sought to wrest control of Madagascarfrom France’s lingering colonial rule.These protestors inspired Sankarato read works by socialist leaderslike Karl Marxand seek wisdom from military strategy.When he returned to Upper Volta in 1973,Sankara was determined to free his country from its colonial legacy.", "Born in 1949,Sankara was raised in a relatively privileged householdas the third of ten children.His parents wanted him to be a priest, but like many of his peers,Sankara saw the military as the perfect institutionto rid Upper Volta of corruption.After returning from Madagascar,he became famous for his charisma and transparent oratorial style—but he was less popular with the reigning government.", "Led by President Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo,this administration came to power in the 3rd consecutive coup d’étatin Upper Volta’s recent history.The administration’s policies were a far cryfrom the sweeping changes Sankara proposed,but, by 1981, Sankara’s popularity won out,earning him a role in Ouédraogo’s government.Nicknamed “Africa’s Che Guevara,\" Sankara rapidly rose through the ranks,and within two years, he was appointed Prime Minister.In his new role, he delivered rallying speechesto impoverished communities, women, and young people.He even tried to persuade other governments to form alliancesbased on their shared colonial legacy.But Ouédraogo and his advisors felt threatened by Sankara’s new position.They thought his communist beliefs would harm alliances with capitalist countries,and just months after becoming Prime Minister,Ouédraogo’s administration forced Sankara from the joband placed him on house arrest.", "Little did the President knowthis act would fuel Upper Volta’s 4th coup d’état in 17 years.Civilian protests ensued around the capital,and the government ground to a haltwhile Sankara tried to negotiate a peaceful transition.During this time, Blaise Compaoré,Sankara’s friend and fellow former soldier,foiled another coup that included an attempt on Sankara’s life.Eventually, Ouédraogo resigned without further violence,and on August 4, 1983, Thomas Sankara became the new President of Upper Volta.", "Finally in charge, Sankara launched an ambitious programfor social and economic change.As one of his first agenda items, he renamed the countryfrom its French colonial title \"Upper Volta\" to \"Burkina Faso,\"which translates to “Land of Upright Men.\"Over the next four years he established a nation-wide literacy campaign,ordered the planting of over 10 million trees,and composed a new national anthem—all while cutting down inflated government employee salaries.But perhaps the most unique element of Sankara’s revolutionwas his dedication to gender equality.He cultivated a movement for women’s liberation,outlawing forced marriages, polygamy and genital mutilation.He was the first African leader to appointwomen to key political positionsand actively recruit them to the military.", "However, Sankara’s socialist policies were met with much resistance.Many students and elites believed his economic planswould alienate Burkina Faso from its capitalist peers.His crackdown on the misuse of public fundsturned government officials against him as well.After four years, what began as an empowering revolutionhad isolated many influential Burkinabes.But Sankara was not ready to yield his power.He executed increasingly authoritarian actions,including banning trade unions and the free press.Eventually, his autocratic tendenciesturned even his closest friends against him.", "On October 15, 1987,Sankara was conducting a meeting when a group of assailantsswarmed his headquarters.Sankara was assassinated in the attack,and many believe the raid was ordered by his friend Blaise Compaoré.", "Though his legacy is complicated,many of Sankara’s policies have proven themselves to be ahead of their time.In the past decade,Burkinabe youth have celebrated Sankara’s political philosophy,and nearby countries like Ghana have even adopted Sankara’s economic models.On March 2, 2019 a statue of Sankara was erected in Burkina Faso’s capital,establishing his place as an icon of revolution for his countryand throughout the world." ] } }

a bottomless ravine.It’s the only thing between them and the towerthat houses the second of three powerful artifacts.They’ve got a brief window of time to get across before the guards return.", "With Hedge’s fuel gauge on empty he won’t be able to fly Ethic across,so the only option is to make a bridge.Fortunately, the floating stacks of stonesnearby are bridge components—invented by Octavia herself— called hover-blocks.Activate a pile with a burst of energy,and they’ll self-assemble to span the ravine as Ethic walks across.But there is, of course, a catch.The hover-blocks are only stable when they’re perfectly palindromic.Meaning they have to form a sequencethat’s the same when viewed forwards and backwards.", "The stacks start in random orders,but will always put themselvesinto a palindromic configurationif they can.If they get to a point where a palindrome isn’t possible,the bridge will collapse,and whoever’s on it will fall into the ravine.", "Let’s look at an example.This stack would make itself stable.First the A blocks hold themselves in place.Then the B’s.And finally the C would nestle right between the B’s.However, suppose there was one more A.First two A blocks form up, then two B’s,but now the remaining C and A have nowhere to go,so the whole thing falls apart.", "The Node of Power enables Hedge to energize a single stack of blocks.What instructions can Ethic give Hedge to allow him to efficiently findand power a stable palindromic stack?", "Pause now to figure it out for yourself.", "Examples of palindromes include ANNA, RACECAR, and MADAM IM ADAM.Counting the number of times a given letter appears in a palindromewill reveal a helpful pattern.", "Pause now to figure it out for yourself.", "Let’s first look at a naïve solution to this problem.A naïve solution is a simple, brute-force approach that isn’t optimized—but will get the job done.Naïve solutions are helpful ways to analyze problems,and work as stepping stones to better solutions.", "In this case, a naïve solutionis to approach a pile of blocks,try all the arrangements,and see if one is a palindrome by reading it forward and then backwards.", "The problem with this approachis that it would take a tremendous amount of time.If Hedge tried one combination every second,a stack of just 10 different blocks would take him 42 days to exhaust.That’s because the total time is a function of the factorialof the number of blocks there are.10 blocks have over 3 million combinations.", "What this naïve solution shows is that we need a much faster wayto tell whether a pile of blocks can form a palindrome.To start, it may be intuitively clear that a pile of all different blockswill never form one.Why?The first and last blocks can’t be the same if there are no repeats.So when can a given sequence become a palindrome?", "One way to figure that out is to analyze a few existing palindromes.In ANNA, there are 2 A’s and 2 N’s.RACECAR has 2 R’s, 2 A’s, 2 C’s, and 1 E.And MADAM IM ADAM has 4 M’s, 4 A’s, 2 D’s, and 1 I.", "The pattern here is that most of the letters occuran even number of times,and there’s at most 1 that occurs just once.Is that it?What if RACECAR had 3 E’s instead of 1?We could tack the new E’s onto the ends and still get a palindrome,so 3 is ok.But make that 3 E’s and 3 C’s, and there’s nowhere for the last C to go.So the most generalized insight is thatat most one letter can appear an odd number of times,but the rest have to be even.", "Hedge can count the letters in each stack and organize them into a dictionary,which is a tidy way of storing information.A loop could then go through and count how many times odd numbers appear.If there are less than 2 odd characters, the stack can be made into a palindrome.", "This approach is much, much faster than the naïve solution.Instead of factorial time, it takes linear time.That’s where the time increasesin proportion to the number of blocks there are.", "Now write a loop for Hedge to approach the piles individually,and stop when he finds a good one, and you’ll be ready to go.", "Here’s what happens:", "Hedge is fast, but there are so many pilesit takes a long

将带来可怕的新官僚主义——我称之为 AI 官僚主义 (algocracy)，也就是说 AI 将脱离人类的控制，仅凭规则做出越来越多重要决策。这有风险吗？当然有。", "我领导的团队由800 名 AI 专家组成，我们为很多全球的大公司量身打造了上百个 AI 系统。我看过太多的公司高管因此重拾了过往的官僚做派。他们对麻烦又老套的人类决策嗤之以鼻，完全依赖 AI

80% 的人工智能计划都集中在效率和增长上，以做出更好的决策——而不是用 AI 取代人类以减少开支。", "为什么人类的作用必不可少？原因很简单：没有人类，AI 会干傻事。有时候 AI 的工作毫无价值，就像这条推文讲的：“亲爱的亚马逊公司，我之前买了一个马桶圈。生活必需品，不是什么癖好。我不收藏马桶圈，我没有马桶圈瘾。不管你的广告邮件多诱人，我都不会觉得‘哦，受不了，只好再买个马桶圈了，偶尔放纵一下自己。’ ”(笑声)", "有时，AI 又“太有帮助”，像这条推文：“我在为妈妈买了骨灰盒后遇到了同样的状况。”", "(笑声)",

很可能就此定下规则，然后拒绝所有来自这个地区的学生，不给任何人证明规则有误的机会。", "并且没有人能够筛查掉这样的规则，因为先进的 AI 一直在学。那么如果直接用 AI 取代人类，迎来的将是 AI 官僚主义的噩梦：谁应该对学生的被拒负责？没有谁，AI 来负责。这公平吗？公平。因为所有学生都用同一规则判定。那可不可以重新考虑这个“住错了地方”的聪明学生？不行，AI 算法不会改变主意。", "我们需要做出选择：继续 AI 的独裁，还是考虑“人类＋AI”思维？要拥有这种思维，我们不能再优先考虑技术，而是要从秘密公式入手。要实现“人类＋AI”，需要 10％ 的编程算法；20％ 的科技成分，包括收集数据，构建用户界面，整合进遗留系统；其余 70％ 是最重要的，是结合 AI 和人类的方法，让结果最接近完美。", "如果这 70％ 被削减，AI

70％，第一步就要保证算法编程由数据科学家和领域专家共同完成。拿医疗领域举例，我们有一个团队曾经处理过一种药产生的小问题。在首次服用这种药后，有很少一部分患者会诱发心脏病。于是所有第一次服用这种药的患者都要住院观察一天，以防心脏病发作。我们想区分出完全不可能发心脏病的患者，这样他们就不用在医院多待一天。我们用 AI 分析了临床试验的数据，寻找心电图、血液成分、生物标记和心脏病发作风险之间的关系。在一个月内，我们训练的模型就能标记出62％ 的零发病风险患者。这样，这些患者就不必白白在医院呆上一天。但是，你会放心地在第一次服药后直接回家，就因为 AI 说你可以回家了？", "(笑声)", "医师也不会放心。万一出现了错误结果呢？也就是说，AI 叫他们回家等死？", "（笑声）", "这就需要那 70％ 的作用了。我们与医师团队合作，检验模型中变量的医学合理性。比方说，我们用肝酶浓度作为预测变量，这里的医学逻辑并不明显，但从统计信号角度看，与结果有很大关系。但万一它是个偏置项呢？（注：即该变量与心脏病无实际关联）所以这个变量会被剔除。我们还剔除了一些变量，因为医师无法精准测出这些变量。四个月后，我们训练出了模型，制定了医学使用协议。它们都获批通过。去年春天，与我们合作的美国医疗机构，为一半服用这种药的患者减轻了压力，提高了生活品质。且这种药的销量迅速增加，超过了一亿份。", "人类团队和方法造就的 70％，也意味着在人类和 AI 之间建立了坚固的联结，以共同解决最难的问题。以前有一个时装零售商问我们：“时装零售商都很会进货，你能不能做一个 AI在预测销量上超过他们？要卖多少件高端服装、浅绿色衣服、加大码男衬衫，能赚到最多钱？能不能预测哪些衣服会大卖，预测得比设计师还准？”我们的团队在几周内用以往销量数据训练出模型，和人类商家比赛。猜猜谁赢了？AI 胜出，预测错误率比人类低 25％。零人类思维者可能会改进模型，投入和人类商家的竞争。开心就好。但我们知道，人类买家对时尚潮流有远见，这是 AI 在以往数据学不到的。", "于是我们转向那 70％，我们开始了第二次测试。人类商家来复查AI 推算的购买量，然后做出必要纠正。结果如何？使用 AI 的人类商家……输了。人类做出的纠正中，有 75％ 都在降低 AI 准确率。", "是不是要放弃人类商家的介入了？不是。我们要重新搭建一个模型，这一次，不让人类猜 AI 的对错，而是让 AI 寻求人类的建议。我们将模型改头换面，抛弃了最初的交互方式：“嘿人类！这是我的预测，帮我纠正一下吧！”改进后的交互方式变得更广泛，像这样：“嘿人类！我不懂明年的流行趋势，可不可以告诉我你押宝在哪？”“嘿人类！可以帮我看看这些大家伙吗？它们超出了我的认知范围。”结果如何？“人类＋AI” 胜出，这次预测错误率降低了 50%。我们花了一年才最终完成这个工具，漫长、成本高，还很艰难，但利润很丰厚，好处很多，每年为零售商节省了超过一亿美金。", "在一些特定议题上，70％ 也意味着人类要决定对错，定下规则限制 AI 的权力。例如设定价格上限，防止 AI 粗暴地抬价，向不知情的顾客漫天要价。只有人类能够设定界限，因为 AI 不可能从以往数据学到。", "有时候我们可能遇到灰色地带。我们曾和保险公司有过合作，他们开发了一个针对客户的 AI 系统，用来识别快要去治病的客户，向他们推销附加产品。问题是，一些接到推销电话的客户，这时候并不知道他们很可能马上要去医院看病。如果你是这家公司的执行长，你会取消这个项目吗？这是个两难的抉择。", "为了解决这个问题，一些公司正在组建团队，帮商业和科技团队制定伦理规则和标准，在个性化和可操作性间寻找平衡点，区别意见和偏见，分清关照和冒犯。", "我坚信在每家公司，把 AI 运用到关键之处定会有巨大回报。商业领袖们要大胆尝试，选择一些项目，为每个项目召集几十个领域佼佼者——科技、AI、科学、伦理——然后完成10％、20％、70％的“人类＋AI”目标。这样 AI 就可以和人类高效合作。除此之外别无他法。", "经济飞速发展的同时，公民已对 AI 官僚主义产生了恐惧。在近期的一项针对七千人的调研中，超过 75％ 的人表示了担忧，担心 AI 影响就业、隐私，担心社会会失去人性。AI 官僚主义的出现会导致公司和社会对 AI 的强烈抵触。“人类＋AI”是唯一选项，只有这样才能让 AI 真正带来福祉。最后，因 AI 获利的组织，要为人类智慧投资，而不仅仅投资 AI 和数据。聘募、培养、奖励人类专家。有人说数据是新的燃料，但相信我，人类知识能改变世界。因为人类知识是唯一的泵，能将蕴藏于数据的“燃料”源源不断地泵出。", "谢谢大家。", "(掌声)" ] } }

a marine biologist --even if they've never seen the ocean.As one seventh graderwho recently completed our program said,\"I could see myself as a scientist,because I enjoyed this game.\"", "This feedback really excited me,because too few studentsdo see themselves as scientists.A 2014 study showed that 57 percentof eighth- and ninth-grade studentssaid, \"Science isn't me.\"Coincidentally, also in 2014,I met Mandë Holford, a marine biochemist,and Lindsay Portnoy,an educational psychologist.The three of us shared a passionfor getting students excited byand comfortable with science.We thought about howwe could give childrenthe most realistic experienceof a scientific career.We discussed the research;it showed that students felt comfortabletaking risks when playing games.", "So the three of us startedan educational games companyto bring science to life.Virtual reality seemed likea low-cost way of increasing access.In addition, academic research has shownthat virtual reality may leadto increases in learning retention.This was perfect for us,as we wanted to be in schoolsso that we could reachthe most number of students possible,particularly students who havebeen underrepresented in science.", "So, with funding fromthe National Science Foundation,we began developingour extended reality programthat combined virtual realitywith personalized digital journaling.We worked with teacherswhile developing itto ensure that it would fit seamlesslyinto existing curriculaand empower teachers to use cutting-edgetechnology in their classroom.We designed the virtual realityfor Google Cardboard,which requires only a smartphoneand a 10 dollar VR viewer made of cardboard.With this inexpensive headset,students are transportedto an underwater expedition.Students use their digital journalto write down their notes,to answer questions,to construct modelsand to develop hypotheses.Students then go to the virtual worldto test their hypothesesand see if they're accurate,much as scientists go to the fieldin their careers.When students returnto their digital journal,they share their observations, claims,reasoning and evidence.The students' written answersand virtual interactionsare all updated livein an educator assessment dashboard,so that teachers can follow their progressand support them as needed.", "To give you a better sense,I'm going to show youa little

go.", "When we were creating BioDive,again, we really wantedto focus on access,so we designed it to requireonly one phone for every four students.We also knew how collaborativescience work is,so we constructed the experienceto only be solvedthrough collaborative teamwork,as each student is an expertin a different geographic location.Given that these children's brainsare still developing,we limited each experience to lasta maximum of two minutes.And finally, because we knowthe importance of repeated exposurefor internalizing knowledge,we constructed BioDive to take placeover five class periods.", "We started piloting BioDive in 2017in 20 schools in New York and New Jersey.We wanted to see studentsas they were using this new technology.In 2019, now,we are now piloting in 26

to learn.\"\"It really gave me realistic examplesof how these organisms appear.\"\"I could see myself as a scientistbecause it seems really fun.\"", "Our feedback wasn't always so positive.When we began developing,we started off by asking studentswhat they liked,what they didn't likeand what they found confusing.Eventually we began askingwhat they wished they could do.Their feedback gave usconcrete items to build into be sure that we were includingstudent voices in what we were designing.Overall, what we have learned is that thisis the beginning of a new platformfor giving

"你如何发现自己的兴趣点或者找到喜欢的职业？是它们自己找上门来？还是你不断地主动尝试寻找？正如儿童权益拥护者Marian Wright Edelman 所说：“你无法变成一个你不了解样子。”幸运的是，我们生活在一个新兴技术可以帮我们解决此问题的时代。", "在过去的两年里，我在开发一个扩展现实项目。它让全国的中学生能够扮演海洋生物学家，哪怕它们从来没有见过大海。正如一个七年级的学生最近完成了我们的项目后说：“我可以把自己看作一个科学家，因为我喜欢这个游戏。”", "这一反馈让我十分的激动，因为很少有学生真的把他们自己视作科学家。一个 2014 年的研究表明，57% 的八年级和九年级学生认为“科学不适合我。”很巧的是，也是在 2014 年，我遇见了一位海洋生物学家，Mandë Holford；还有一位教育心理学家，Lindsay Portnoy。我们三个有一个共同的爱好，就是让学生们适应并且爱上科学。我们思考如何能给孩子们带来一个最真实的科学职业体验。我们讨论了这个研究，它表明学生能够在玩游戏时很自然地冒险。", "所以我们三个成立了一个教育性质的游戏公司，赋予科学以生命。虚拟现实看起来是个低成本的扩大受众群体的方式。此外，有学术研究表明，虚拟现实或许能增强学习的记忆力。这对我们来说再好不过了，因为我们想在学校里实施，这样我们就可以接触到尽可能多的学生，尤其是那些很少接触科学的学生。", "在获得了国家科学基金会的支持后，我们开始创办扩展现实项目，它结合了虚拟现实（VR）和个性化数字日志。我们在研发过程中和教师们一起工作，这样可以保证该项目能和现有课程的无缝对接，并且老师们能够在课堂上使用先进的技术。我们为 Google Cardboard 设计了虚拟现实体验，只需要一部智能手机和一个成本只有 10 美元，用硬纸板制成的 VR 查看器。有了这个便宜的装置，学生们参与了一次水下考察。学生们用电子日志记笔记，回答问题 ，构建模型，并提出假说。之后，学生们进入虚拟世界来验证他们的假说，看它们是否正确，就像科学家们在他们的工作中去实地考察一样。当学生们回到了电子日志，他们会分享自己的观察，主张，推理还有证据。学生们写下的答案还有虚拟的互动都会在一个教育评估操作界面被实时更新，这样老师们就可以监督他们的进度，并在他们需要的时候给予帮助。", "为了使你们有一个更直观的感受，我下面要向大家展示学生们看到的一些东西。这个虚拟现实片段的内容是，他们正在水下观察动植物群。利用这个电子日志，他们能根据这些非生物数据建立模型，来展示他们希望看到的东西。这里，他们正用定性的陈述来支持他们的模型。这个是教育操作界面，能够显示学生的进度，并且让老师们看到进展过程中学生们的答案。", "需要强调的是，当我们设计 BioDive 时，我们想聚焦在访问性上，所以在设计时，让它支持每四名学生只能用一部手机。我们也知道科学工作多么需要合作，所以我们设计的这些体验只能通过合作完成，每个学生在不同的地理位置是名专家。鉴于这些孩子们的大脑仍在发育，我们将每次体验的时长限制在两分钟内。最后，我们知道反复温习对于内化知识十分重要，于是设计让 BioDive 延续超过五个课时。", "我们于 2017 年开始在纽约和新泽西的 20 所学校试验 BioDive。我们想观察学生们使用这项新技术。在 2019，也就是现在，我们已经在 26 个州进行试用。我们听教过这个项目的老师们说：“鉴于我们在俄亥俄州，这是一种不需要花大价钱就能向学生展示海洋动力学的方式。”", "（笑声)", "“这十分令人兴奋。”“学生们完全参与了进来。”但是真正给了我们希望的是我们从学生那儿听到的话。“我喜欢那种身临其境的感觉。”“这是一种互动性且有趣的学习方式。”“这给了我一个实例，让我知道这些生物长什么样子。”“我感觉自己就像科学家，因为这看起来很有趣。”", "不过我们得到的反馈不总是好的。我们刚开始研发时，我们从问学生他们喜欢什么，不喜欢什么，还有他们对什么感到疑惑开始。最后我们问他们：他们希望自己能干什么。他们的回答让我们知道具体应该在项目中加入什么，以保证我们在设计的项目中融合了学生们的愿望。总的来说，我们了解到这是一个新平台的开始。它给学生们发声的机会和所有权在决定他们如何对自己未来的职业造成影响。", "我们把精力集中在科学上，因为我们知道人类需要科学家来解决现有的和未来的挑战。不过，虚拟现实可以在各个领域帮到学生。我们如何利用这些令人大开眼界的经历和从主要资源中学习的机会来帮助学生探索他们的愿望？我们可以为廉价的耳机添加 VR 功能，让学生们沉浸在口头文学中，或者历史上的重要时刻吗？",

winter.Now she emerges into the spring air to begin her reign.", "Most of her sisters weren’t so lucky.While hibernating in compost piles and underground burrows,many sleeping queens were eaten by spiders.Warm winters caused by climate change led other queens to emerge early,only to find there was no available food.And some queens that survived the winter fell victim to the threats of spring,such as carnivorous plants, birds, and manmade pesticides.Our queen is the lone survivor of her old hive, and now,she must become the foundress of a new one.", "But first, breakfast.The queen heads for a citrus grove full of honeybee hives.The bees can be dangerous if provoked,but right now they’re paralyzed by the morning cold.Their hairy bodies are dripping with sugar water from an earlier feeding,and the resourceful queen licks them for a morning snack.", "Newly energized, our queen searches for a safe nesting area.This tree hollow, safe from rain, wind, and predators, is ideal.She chews the surrounding wood and plant fibersto make a paper-like pulp.Then she builds around 50 brood cells that comprise the beginning of her nest.Using sperm stored from last fall,the queen lays a fertilized egg into each cell,producing as many as 12 in 20 minutes.Within a week, these will hatch into female larva.But until then, the queen must hunt down smaller insects to feed her brood,all while expanding the hive, laying eggs,and defending against intruders.Fortunately, our queen is well prepared.Unlike bees, wasps can sting as many timesas they need to.", "With such a busy schedule, the queen barely has time to feed herself.Luckily, she doesn’t have to.When she feeds an insect to her grubs,they digest the bug into a sugary substance that sustains their mother.By the end of July, these first larva have matured into adult workers,ready to take on foraging, building, and defense.The queen can now lay eggs full-time,sustaining herself on her worker’s spoils and their unfertilized eggs.", "Although each worker only lives for roughly 3 weeks,the queen’s continuous egg-laying swells their ranks.In just one summer, the nest reaches the size of a basketball,supporting thousands of workers.Such a large population needs to eat,and the nearby garden provides a veritable buffet.As the swarm descends, alarmed humans try to swat them.They even fight back with pesticides that purposefully poison wasps,and inadvertently impact a wide-range of local wildlife.But the wasps are actually vital to this ecosystem.Sitting at the top of the local invertebrate food chain,these insects keep spiders, mites, and centipedes, in check.Wasps consume crop-eating insects,making them particularly helpful for farms and gardens.They even pollinate fruits and vegetables,and help winemakers by biting into their grapesand jump-starting fermentation.", "This feast continues until autumn, when the foundress changes course.She begins grooming some eggs into a new generation of queens,while also laying unfertilized eggsthat will mature into reproductive males called drones.This new crop of queens and males requires more food.But with summer over, the usual sources run dry,and the foraging wasps start taking more aggressive risks.", "By September, the hive’s organization deteriorates.Hungry workers no longer clean the nest and various scavengers move in.Just when it seems the hive can no longer sustain itself,the fertile queens and their drones depart in a massive swarm.", "As the days grow colder, the workers starve,and our queen reaches the end of her lifespan.But above, a swarm of reproductive wasps has successfully mated.The males die off shortly after,but the newly fertilized queens are ready to find shelter for their long sleep.And this woodpile looks like the perfect place to spend the winter." ], "zh-cn" : [ "四月，太阳从一堆木柴上方升起,皇室的气息开始在其中蔓延。这只黄蜂蜂后是上千只在去年秋天交配过的且冬眠熬过寒冬的蜂后中的一员。现在，它在春风中苏醒，开始它的王朝。", "然而，它大多数的姐妹并没有这么幸运。在堆肥和地洞中冬眠时，许多沉睡中的蜂后都被蜘蛛吃掉了。气候变化导致的暖冬使得许多蜂后们早早苏醒却发现无法找到食物。一些熬过冬天的蜂后则未能逃过春日危机，例如食虫植物、鸟类和人造杀虫剂。", "我们的蜂后是它旧蜂巢中的唯一幸存者，而现在，它必须成为一个新蜂巢的创建者。",

个蜂室作为巢穴的基底。借助去年秋天储存的精子，这只蜂后在每个蜂室中产下一枚受精卵，每 20 分钟产量高达 12 枚。一周内，这些受精卵会孵化为雌性幼虫。在那之前，蜂后必须捕食小昆虫来喂养幼卵，与此同时还要扩建巢穴、产卵、并抵御入侵者。还好，我们的蜂后做好了充足的准备。和蜜蜂不同，黄蜂的叮蛰没有次数限制。", "在如此繁忙的行程下，蜂后基本没空进食。幸运的是，它也不一定需要。当它给幼虫喂食昆虫时，幼虫会将虫子消化为含糖物质来供养母亲。等到七月末，最初的幼虫成长为成年工蜂，开始接手觅食、建造和防御的工作。蜂后一心一意地开始产卵，依靠工蜂的供养和它们未受精的卵维持生存。", "尽管每只工蜂仅能存活大约三周的时间，但蜂后不停地产卵使得它们的队伍持续增长。仅仅一个夏天，巢穴就变得像篮球一样大，可供上千工蜂栖息。数量如此庞大的蜂群需要食物来维持，而旁边花园里名副其实的“自助餐”可以满足它们的需求。随着蜂群逼近，警惕的人类尝试拍打它们。他们甚至使用专灭黄蜂的杀虫剂来回击，不经意间影响到了当地很多的野生动物。事实上，黄蜂对于生态系统非常关键。坐拥无脊椎动物食物链顶端，这些昆虫控制着蜘蛛、螨虫和蜈蚣的数量。黄蜂会消耗吃农作物的昆虫，以此帮助农田和花园。它们甚至帮助水果和蔬菜授粉，并且通过叮咬葡萄，使其快速启动发酵的方法来帮助酿酒人。", "秋天，这场盛会随着蜂后目标的改变而落幕。它开始将一些卵养育为新一代的蜂后，同时也继续产下未受精的可成长为工蜂的雄性生殖蜂。新出生的雌蜂和雄蜂需要更多的食物，但随着夏季的结束，食物来源消耗殆尽。觅食的黄蜂开始面对更多凶险。", "九月，蜂巢的组织体系逐渐恶化。饥饿的工蜂不再清理巢穴，于是许多清道夫侵入。当巢穴无法再继续维持时，具有繁殖能力的蜂后和它的守护者们浩浩荡荡地离开了。", "随着天气逐渐寒冷，工蜂们会被饿死。我们的蜂后已走到了人生最后阶段。好在一群生殖黄蜂已成功交配。雄蜂不久之后就会死去，新受孕的蜂后也已经准备好去寻找冬眠的庇护所了。这堆木柴看起来像是过冬的完美之地。" ] } }
